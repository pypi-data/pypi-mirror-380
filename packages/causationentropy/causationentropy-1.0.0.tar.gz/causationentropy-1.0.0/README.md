A Python library for discovering causal networks from time series data using **Optimal Causation Entropy (oCSE)**.

## Overview

CausationEntropy implements state-of-the-art information-theoretic methods for causal discovery from multivariate time series. The library provides robust algorithms that can identify causal relationships while controlling for confounding variables and false discoveries.

### What it does

Given time series data, CausationEntropy finds which variables cause changes in other variables by:

1. **Predictive Testing**: Testing if knowing variable X at time t helps predict variable Y at time t+1
2. **Information Theory**: Using conditional mutual information to measure predictive relationships
3. **Statistical Control**: Rigorous statistical testing to avoid false discoveries
4. **Multiple Methods**: Supporting various information estimators and discovery algorithms

## Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)
```bash
pip install causationentropy
```

### Development Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Center-For-Complex-Systems-Science/causationentropy.git
cd causationentropy
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from causationentropy import discover_network

# Load your time series data (variables as columns, time as rows)
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Discover causal network
network = discover_network(data, method='standard', max_lag=5)
```

**Note:** This implementation of this algorithm runs in `O(n^2 T log T)` where `N` is the number of variables and `T` is the length of the time series. Application of this algorithm without optimizations is computationally intensive. When running this algorithm, please be patient. Optimizations of the algorithm are planned for a later release that leverage singular value decomposition and KD-Trees. However, these optimizations are not part of the original algorithm. Adding additional lags also contributes to additional performance degradations.

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Configure discovery parameters
network = discover_network(
    data,
    method='standard',          # 'standard', 'alternative', 'information_lasso', or 'lasso'
    information='gaussian',     # 'gaussian', 'knn', 'kde', 'geometric_knn', or 'poisson'
    max_lag=5,                  # Maximum time lag to consider
    alpha_forward=0.05,         # Forward selection significance
    alpha_backward=0.05,        # Backward elimination significance
    n_shuffles=200              # Permutation test iterations
)
```

### Synthetic Data Example

```python
from causationentropy.datasets import synthetic

# Generate synthetic causal time series
data, true_network = synthetic.linear_stochastic_gaussian_process(
    n_variables=5, 
    n_samples=1000, 
    sparsity=0.3
)

# Discover network
discovered = discover_network(data)
```

## Key Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Standard, alternative, information lasso, and lasso variants of oCSE
- **Flexible Information Estimators**: Gaussian, k-NN, KDE, geometric k-NN, and Poisson methods  
- **Statistical Rigor**: Permutation-based significance testing with comprehensive test coverage
- **Synthetic Data**: Built-in generators for testing and validation
- **Visualization**: Network plotting and analysis tools
- **Performance**: Optimized implementations with parallel processing support

## Mathematical Foundation

The algorithm uses **conditional mutual information** to quantify causal relationships:

$$I(X; Y | Z) = H(X | Z) + H(Y | Z) - H(X, Y | Z)$$

This measures how much variable X tells us about variable Y, beyond what we already know from conditioning set Z.

**Causal Discovery Rule**: Variable X causes Y if knowing X(t) significantly improves prediction of Y(t+1), even when controlling for all other relevant variables.

The algorithm implements a two-phase approach:
1. **Forward Selection**: Iteratively adds predictors that maximize conditional mutual information
2. **Backward Elimination**: Removes predictors that lose significance when conditioned on others
