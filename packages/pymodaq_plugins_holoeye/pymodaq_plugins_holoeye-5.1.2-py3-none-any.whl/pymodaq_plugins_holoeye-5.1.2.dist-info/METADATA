Set of PyMoDAQ plugins for Spatial Light Modulators (SLM) from Holoeye


Authors
=======

* Sebastien J. Weber  (sebastien.weber@cemes.fr)


Instruments
===========

Below is the list of instruments included in this plugin

Actuators
+++++++++

* **HoloeyeFile**: Used to load phase data into the SLM from a file
* **HoloeyeFullScreen**: Used to load a constant (and controllable) phase into the SLM
* **HoloeyeSplitScreen**: Used to load a binary phase mask into the SLM and control both the
  split ratio (percentage of vertical/horizontal screen size) and the phase level in each.

Infos
=====

The SDK from Holoeye is required to operate those plugins. All plugins can also receive a numpy
array directly to be loaded into the SLM.
