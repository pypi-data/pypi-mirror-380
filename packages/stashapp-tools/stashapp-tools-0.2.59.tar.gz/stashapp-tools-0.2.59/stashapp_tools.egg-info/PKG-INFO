        ## Requirements
        Developed using python 3.11.X with attempts to make things as backwards compatible where possible, if you are having issues please try using python 3.11
        
        ## Installation 
        
        ##### To install from PyPI use this command:
        `pip install stashapp-tools`
        
        ##### To install directly from this repo use this command:
        `pip install git+https://github.com/stg-annon/stashapp-tools`
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        import stashapi.log as log
        from stashapi.stashapp import StashInterface
        
        stash = StashInterface({
            "scheme": "http",
            "host":"localhost",
            "port": "9999",
            "logger": log
        })
        
        scene_data = stash.find_scene(1234)
        log.info(scene_data)
