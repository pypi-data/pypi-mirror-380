# RAFINA: Python module for reading RAF files

This python module allows reading files of RAF type, which are produced by
some SINTEF Ocean finite element analysis programs.

In addition to storing results for post-processing purposes, the file
may contain required data for analysis restarts.

Programs using the RAF format include **SIMLA**, **BFLEX** and **UFLEX**.

Two file extensions are in use for RAF storage: .raf and .dyn for **XPOST**
readable and **DYNPOST** readable, respectively. The latter is used for storing
time series produced by **SIMLA**.

The module contains a class Raf, which is initialized with the filename of a
RAF file.

The module has been extended with a class Dyn, which accepts .dyn files with
program type **DYNPOST/SIMLA**. This file format is essentially a RAF file
(though unreadable by **XPOST**) which provides time series rather than the FEM
element/nodal/integration point results visualized as snapshots at a given
loadstep. Note that reading a .dyn file to a Dyn object includes all of the
time series as stored on file in their entirety, including trailing zeroes.

## Usage example

```python
from rafina import pyraf as pr
myRafFile = pr.Raf("filename.raf")
print(myRafFile.header())
print(myRafFile.timestamp())

# This reads a named array at a given loadstep directly from file to a numpy array
tugcor = myRafFile.array('TUGCOR',0)

myDynFile = pr.Dyn("filename.dyn")
print("Found", myDynFile.nres, "time series in", myDynFile.filename())
for timeseries_name in myDynFile.timeseries_names:
  print(timeseries_name)
```
