1. **Network Scanning**: Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **Rate Limiting**: Use appropriate timeout and concurrency settings to avoid overwhelming target systems
3. **Credentials**: Never include credentials or sensitive information in scan configurations
4. **Logs**: Be careful with log outputs in shared environments
