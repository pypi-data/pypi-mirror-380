# Taxonomic and Protein Style Guide

## Order Styles
### Colors
- Transparent versions (0.8 opacity) of the family colors
- Each major taxonomic group has its own color family:
  - Marine snails: Reddish tones
  - Scorpions: Golden yellows
  - Spiders: Purples
  - Snakes/Lizards: Greens
  - Fish: Blues (light to dark)
  - Wasps/Bees: Oranges
  - Centipedes: Olives
  - Other groups: Distinctive unique colors

### Shapes
- Open versions of the family shapes
- Shapes chosen to reflect taxonomic group characteristics:
  - Marine snails: Circle (shell-like)
  - Scorpions: Diamond-open (tail-like)
  - Spiders: Cross-open (web-like)
  - Snakes: Triangle-right-open (head-like)
  - Fish: Triangle-left-open (fish profile)
  - Wasps/Bees: Hexagon-open (honeycomb)
  - Centipedes: Line-ew-open (elongated body)
  - Other groups: Distinctive shapes (star, pentagon, octagon, etc.)

## Family Styles
### Colors
- Full opacity (1.0) versions of order colors
- Color gradients within taxonomic groups:
  - Marine snails: Red → Coral → Salmon
  - Scorpions: Gold → Goldenrod → Dark goldenrod
  - Spiders: Various purple and pink shades
  - Snakes: Dark green → Sea green → Light sea green
  - Fish: Light blue → Royal blue → Dark blue
  - Wasps/Bees: Orange → Dark orange → Orange red
  - Centipedes: Olive → Olive drab

### Shapes
- Solid/filled versions of order shapes
- Shape consistency within taxonomic groups:
  - Marine snails: Circle-dot
  - Scorpions: Diamond
  - Spiders: Cross
  - Snakes: Triangle-right
  - Fish: Triangle-left
  - Wasps/Bees: Hexagon
  - Centipedes: Line-ew
  - Lizards: Square
  - Other groups: Distinctive shapes

## Protein Category Styles
### Colors
- Full opacity (1.0)
- Grouped by functional similarity:
  - Scorpion toxins: Orange spectrum
  - Cone snail toxins: Bright red spectrum
  - Snake toxins: Dark red spectrum
  - Proteases: Purple spectrum
  - Phospholipases: Blue-purple spectrum
  - Peptide modulators: Light blue spectrum
  - Growth/binding proteins: Teal/green spectrum
  - Antimicrobial compounds: Bright green spectrum
  - Other proteins: Gray

### Shapes
- Complex shapes reflecting protein function:
  - Channel toxins: Star variants (star-triangle-up/down)
  - Enzyme toxins: Hexagram/hexagon variants
  - Binding proteins: Diamond variants
  - Peptide toxins: Triangle variants
  - Other proteins: Cross-thin

## Hierarchical Logic
1. **Orders**: Base colors, transparent, open shapes
2. **Families**: More specific colors, solid, filled shapes
3. **Proteins**: Function-based colors, complex geometric shapes

## Visual Relationships
- Related taxa share similar colors and shapes
- Higher taxonomic ranks have simpler, more open shapes
- More specific classifications have more detailed shapes
- Functional similarity in proteins is shown through color grouping
- Protein shapes reflect molecular function rather than taxonomy

## Color Progression
- Warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows): Venomous/toxic proteins
- Cool colors (blues, greens): Regulatory/binding proteins
- Purple spectrum: Enzymatic proteins
- Grays: Miscellaneous/other proteins

## Shape Progression
- Simple shapes: Higher taxonomic ranks
- Complex shapes: Specific protein functions
- Open shapes: Higher taxonomic ranks
- Filled shapes: More specific classifications
- Star variants: Toxic compounds
- Geometric shapes: Regulatory proteins
