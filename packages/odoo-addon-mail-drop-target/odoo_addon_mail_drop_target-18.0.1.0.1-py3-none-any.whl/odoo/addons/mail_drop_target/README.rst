This module was written to allow users to drag&drop emails from their
desktop to Odoo.

It supports as well RFC822 .eml files as Outlook .msg (those only if `an
extra library <https://github.com/mattgwwalker/msg-extractor>`__ is
installed) files.

When the mail is dropped to an odoo record, it will automatically send a
notification of that new message that has been added to all the existing
followers. It is possible to disable this notification.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. save your emails on the desktop / somewhere in the file system
2. drag them to your browser, and drop them on the chatter of the record
   you want to attach your email to

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- most mail clients won't allow you to drag mails directly from the mail
  client, you'll need some plugin for that
- for corporate environments, it might be feasible to support imap URLs
  and get the mail in question on the server side
