    A new "token_labels" option has been added to the PKCS#11 driver which
    supersedes the previous "token_label" option.  The new option is used to
    specify a list of tokens that can be used by Barbican.  This is required
    for some HSM devices that use separate tokens for load balancing.  For most
    use cases the new option will just have a single token.  The old option
    is deprecated, but will still be used if present.

    The "token_label" option in the PKCS#11 driver is deprecated.  Th new
    "token_labels" option should be used instead.  If present, "token_label"
    will still be used by appending it to "token_labels".
