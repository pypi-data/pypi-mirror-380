    The current policy only allows users with the key-manager:service-admin
    role to list, get, add, update or delete project quotas.  The new
    policy allows system readers to list quotas and get quotas for specific
    projects and system admins (role:admin and system_scope:all) to add,
    update and delete project quotas.
