  This version adds support to the secret consumers and microversions
  functionalities.  The detailed secret consumers specification can
  be found on <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/barbican-specs/specs/train/secret-consumers.html>.

  Microversions allow clients to interact with Barbican server to gather
  information on minimum and maximum versions supported by the server.
  More information can be found on <https://docs.openstack.org/barbican/latest/api/microversions.html>.

    The secret consumers functionality allows other OpenStack projects,
    such as Cinder and Glance, to name a few, to register consumers
    of secrets.  This is useful when a project wants to make an end
    user aware that it is using the secret.

    Secret consumers do not block the secret to be deleted by the end
    user though.  When an end user needs to delete a secret that has
    consumers, it can simply do it.  However, deletion of secrets with
    consumers must be forced using a corresponding parameter, either
    in the client's CLI or in the client's API.

    Microversions enable clients to do a server supported version
    discovery, allowing old clients (not supporting the feature) to
    interact with newer servers.
