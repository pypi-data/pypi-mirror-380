    The hsm subcommand for the barbican-manage command line tool no longer
    requires any parameters at run time.  If any value used by the PKCS#11
    value is needed it will be taken from /etc/barbican/barbican.conf.
    You may continue to specify any values on the command line, and those
    will take precedence over the values specified in barbican.conf, so any
    existing scripts that use barbican-manage should continue to work as
    expected.
