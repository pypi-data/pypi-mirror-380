    Added two options for the PKCS#11 Crypto Plugin:
    `[p11_crypto_plugin]/token_serial_number` and
    `[p11_crypto_plugin]/token_label`.  Both are optional and can be used
    instead of `[p11_crypto_plugin]/slot_id` to identify the Token to be
    used by the PKCS#11 plugin.  When either one of the new options is defined
    the plugin will search all slots on the PKCS#11 device for a token that
    matches the given value.  `token_serial_number` has the highest precendence
    and other values will be ignored when this value is set.  If
    `token_serial_number` is not set, then `token_label` has
    the next highest precedence and `slot_id` will be ignored.
    `slot_id` will be used when neither one of the new options is set.
