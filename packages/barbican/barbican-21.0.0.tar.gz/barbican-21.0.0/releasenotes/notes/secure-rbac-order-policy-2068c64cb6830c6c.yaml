    Implement secure-rbac for orders resource.
security:
  - |
    The current policy allows all users except those with the audit role to
    list orders or retrieve an orders metadata.  The new desired policy will
    restrict this to members.  For backwards compatibility, the old policies
    remain in effect, but they are deprecated and will be removed in future,
    leaving the more restrictive new policy.
  - |
    The new secure-rbac policy allows for secret deletion by members.  This is
    a change from the previous policy that only allowed deletion by the
    project admin.
