    Added a new subcommand to `barbican-manage`:

        barbican-manage simple_crypto new_pkek --project $PROJECT_ID

    This new command creates a new Project-specific Key-encryption-key (pKEK)
    for the specified project.  New secrets created in that project will be
    encrypted with this new pKEK.  Existing secrets are not modified by this
    command.
