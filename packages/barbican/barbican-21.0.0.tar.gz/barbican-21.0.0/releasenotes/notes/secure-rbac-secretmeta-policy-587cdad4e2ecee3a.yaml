    The current policy allows all users except those with the audit role to
    list a secrets metadata keys and get the metadata values. The new
    desired policy will restrict this to members.  For backwards
    compatibility, the old policies remain in effect, but they are
    deprecated and will be removed in future, leaving the more restrictive
    new policy.

    The new secure-rbac policy allows for secret metadata addition,
    modification and deletion by members.  This is a change from the previous
    policy that only allowed deletion by the project admin or the secret
    creator.
