    Added a new subcommand to `barbican-manage`:

        barbican-manage simple_crypto rewrap_secrets --project $PROJECT_ID

    This new command re-encrypts all secrets using the latest active Project-
    specific Key-encryption-key (pKEK) for the specified project.  This enables
    administrator to rotate pKEKs so that old pKEKs can be safely deleted from
    the database.
