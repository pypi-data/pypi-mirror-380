# NowcastNet-Rewritten

## 1. Introduction

This project is a personal reimplementation of the NowcastNet inference framework. The original research, titled "Skilful nowcasting of extreme precipitation with NowcastNet," by Yuchen Zhang, Mingsheng Long et al., was published in Nature and can be accessed at <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06184-4>. Additionally, the original code by Yuchen Zhang is available at <https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.0832447.v1>.

> Q: Why reimplement? A: Just for learning :)

## 2. Getting Started

1. Cloning the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VioletsOleander/nowcastnet-rewritten.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies (pick one of the following methods):

    - Sync dependencies using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

        ```bash
        uv sync
        ```

    - Make sure `python>=3.10,<3.11`, and either install from PyPI:

        ```bash
        pip install -U nowcastnet-rewritten
        ```

        or install from local:

        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```

> **Notes:**
>
> - [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is recommended for managing dependencies for full reproducibility.
> - To ensure compatibility with this reimplementation's architecture, weights have been modified and are available for download from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/VioletsOleander/nowcastnet-rewritten).

## 3. Usage

To perform inference, run `inference.py` with the required arguments.

To view all available arguments, use:

```bash
python inference.py -h
```

It is recommended to use the `--config_path` option to specify the configuration file, for example:

```bash
python inference.py --config_path ../configs/inference.toml
```

An example configuration file is provided in the `configs/` directory.

You can also specify options directly from the command line, for example:

```bash
python inference.py \
    --case_type normal \
    --device cuda:0 \
    path_to_weights \
    path_to_data \
    path_to_result
```

> **Note:** If `--config_path` is specified, other command line options will be ignored.
