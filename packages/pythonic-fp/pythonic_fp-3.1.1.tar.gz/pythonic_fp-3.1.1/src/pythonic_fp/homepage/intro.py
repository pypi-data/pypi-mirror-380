Pythonic FP Projects
====================

Collection of Functional Programming (FP) PyPI projects.

The overall project's name is **Pythonic FP** and consists of PyPI
projects with PyPI and GitHub names beginning `python-fp`. All project
libraries install under the Python ``pythonic_fp`` namespace.

Goals
-----

- assist in a functional style of programming
- support stateful as well as functional paradigms
- be extensible, type safe, and efficient
- threadsafe when practical, thread tolerant when efficiency important
- have good documentation
- fulling support typing tools like `mypy <https://mypy-lang.org/>`_
- be pythonic

Non-Goals
---------

- try and make Python a pure functional language like Haskell
- implement a functional domain specific language in Python
- force users to adopt unpythonic cryptic coding styles
