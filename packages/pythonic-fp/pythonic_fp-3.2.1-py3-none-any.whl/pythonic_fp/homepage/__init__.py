The pythonic-fp PyPI project is the central component of the
*Pythonic FP* libraries. It has several purposes.

- claims the pythonic-fp name on PyPI for the overall effort
- hosts on *GitHub Pages*

  - the *Python FP* homepage
  - Sphinx documentation for each *Pythonic FP* project

- home of the ``pythonic_fp.homepage`` module
- provides locations for overarching CHANGELOG and README files

  - each *Pythonic FP* project has its on CHANGELOG and README files

There is no need to install pythonic-fp itself, but does not hurt
anything if it is installed.
