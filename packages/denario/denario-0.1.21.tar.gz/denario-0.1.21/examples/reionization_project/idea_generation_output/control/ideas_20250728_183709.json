[{"title": "Constraining the Evolution of the Escape Fraction of Ionizing Photons Using Redshift-Dependent Ionization Fraction Data", "summary": "Develops a semianalytical model to study the evolution of the escape fraction of ionizing photons as a function of redshift and halo mass. Utilizes constraints on ionization fraction from table 5.1 to inform the model. Incorporates a Bayesian framework to quantify uncertainties and break degeneracies with other parameters such as source luminosity and clumping factor. Aims to provide a novel parameterization of the escape fraction and explore its impact on the reionization history. Proposes methods to model the shape of the reionization history and validate predictions against additional observables like UV luminosity functions. Findings will help refine theoretical models of reionization and aid in interpreting future observational data."}]
