**Idea:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Gravitational Wave Data Imputation and Glitch Mitigation.

**Description:** Develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to simultaneously impute missing data segments and mitigate glitches in gravitational wave data. The PINN will be trained to satisfy the Einstein field equations (or a simplified wave equation approximation) within the observed data, while also learning to identify and suppress glitch-related noise patterns. The network's loss function will incorporate both data fidelity terms (matching observed data where available) and physics-based regularization terms (enforcing the wave equation). This approach leverages physical priors to improve data quality and robustness against non-Gaussian noise, leading to enhanced signal detection and parameter estimation.
