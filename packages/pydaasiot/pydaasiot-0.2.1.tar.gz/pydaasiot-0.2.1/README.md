**pydaasiot** are the official Python bindings for the **DaaS‚ÄëIoT SDK**.  
They expose the full power of the Device‚Äëas‚Äëa‚ÄëService paradigm directly into Python, making it easy to integrate IoT communication primitives, overlay networking and time synchronization into Python applications.

---

## üåê Overview

The **DaaS‚ÄëIoT SDK** is a high‚Äëperformance library designed for distributed IoT environments.  
It provides an overlay communication model on top of TCP/IP, with support for multiple drivers and precise ATS (Accurate Time Synchronization) mechanisms.

The Python package `pydaasiot` allows developers and researchers to access these capabilities without writing C++ code, simplifying prototyping and integration into data pipelines, experiments and services.

---

## ‚ú® Main Features

- Initialization and management of **DaaS‚ÄëIoT nodes**.
- Add and configure network drivers (currently **INET4** and **Bluetooth**; more drivers such as Serial, USB, UART, MQTT are planned).  
- Send and receive packets between devices.  
- Retrieve and manage ATS synchronization parameters.  
- Cross‚Äëplatform: distributed as prebuilt wheels for **Windows (MSVC)** and **Linux (manylinux2014)**.  

---

## üöÄ Installation

Install from PyPI with:

```bash
pip install pydaasiot
```

Wheels are available for Python 3.9 ‚Äì 3.12.  
`pip` will automatically choose the correct wheel for your OS and Python version.

---

## üß™ Quick Example

```python
import pydaasiot

# Initialize a DaaS-IoT node
node = pydaasiot.Node()
node.init()

# Add a network driver (example: IPv4 link)
node.add_driver(2, "127.0.0.1:5000")

# Send a packet
node.push(b"Hello from Python")

# Receive packets (non-blocking)
packets = node.pull()
print("Received:", packets)

# Access ATS parameters
ats = node.get_sync_params()
print("ATS:", ats)
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported Platforms

- **Windows** (x86_64, MSVC)
- **Linux** (x86_64, manylinux2014)

macOS support is planned for a future release.

## üìö Documentation

- Full SDK documentation: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-org/pydaasiot)  
- Examples: available in the repository under `examples/` (not included in the PyPI package).

## üîß Development

Development is organized into feature branches for specific platforms.  
The `main` branch is cross‚Äëplatform and serves as the source for official PyPI releases.  
Tagged versions (`vX.Y.Z`) trigger CI pipelines that build wheels for Windows and Linux and publish them to PyPI.
