    Dell PowerFlex driver: The fix for `Bug #2114879
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2114879>`_ requires
    ``os-brick`` version 6.13.0 or greater. Users do not need to
    create the `/opt/emc/scaleio/openstack/connector.conf` file
    on the hosts using ``os-brick``.

    Follow the steps below to upgrade:

    1. Upgrade ``os-brick`` to version 6.13.0 without removing
       the configuration file. This version can perform mapping
       if the driver has not yet done so, provided the configuration
       file remains intact.
    2. Then upgrade the PowerFlex driver to version 3.6.0 or later.
       Note that driver version 3.6.0 requires ``os-brick`` version 6.13.0
       or higher to function correctly and will not operate with
       earlier versions of ``os-brick``.
    3. The connector configuration file can now be safely removed.

    Dell PowerFlex driver `Bug #2114879
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/2114879>`_:
    This release contains an updated Dell PowerFlex driver. It must
    be used with ``os-brick`` version 6.13.0 or greater. ``os-brick``
    no longer requires access to PowerFlex backend secrets, and
    all that is handled by the cinder driver now.
