    With the adoption of New Location APIs, we need a mechanism
    to perform service-to-service communication to access the
    ``add_image_location`` and ``get_image_locations`` APIs.
    To achieve the desired functionality, we will need to perform
    two additional changes during the deployment:

    1. Assign the ``admin`` and ``service`` role to the ``glance`` user
    2. Configure a ``[glance]`` section in cinder configuration file
       with the credentials of ``glance`` user and ``service`` project.
       Refer to the ``[nova]`` or ``[service_user]`` section for reference.

    Added support for service-to-service communication between Cinder and
    Glance.
    Currently the service-to-service communication is leveraged by the new
    location APIs for which we will need to configure a dedicated ``[glance]``
    section in cinder configuration file with the credentials of ``glance``
    user and ``service`` project.
    Refer to the ``[nova]`` or ``[service_user]`` section for reference.
