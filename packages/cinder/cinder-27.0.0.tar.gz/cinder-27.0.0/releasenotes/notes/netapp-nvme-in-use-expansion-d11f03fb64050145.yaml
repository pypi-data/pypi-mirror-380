    **NetApp NVMe namespace support for in-use expansion**

    Added support for in-use expansion of NetApp NVMe namespaces, allowing
    volumes to be resized while attached to running instances without
    requiring detachment. This feature enables seamless volume expansion
    for NVMe-backed volumes in NetApp ONTAP environments.

    Key capabilities:

    * **In-use expansion**: Volumes can be expanded while attached to running instances
    * **NVMe namespace compatibility**: Full support for NetApp NVMe namespace expansion
