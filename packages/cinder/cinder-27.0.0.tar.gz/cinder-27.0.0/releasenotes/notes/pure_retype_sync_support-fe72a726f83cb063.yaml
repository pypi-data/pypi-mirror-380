    Pure Storage: Added support for retyping a
    simple or async-replicated volume into a
    sync or trisync-replicated volume.
    Additionally, the ``cinder manage`` command may
    now be used to bring existing sync replicated volumes
    under cinder control, when previously these sort of
    volumes could not be managed.
