    Dell PowerMax Driver: use consistency exempt flag consistently
    PowerMax allows volumes to be added, removed, or suspended without
    affecting the state of the SRDF/A or SRDF/Metro session or requiring
    that other volumes in the session be suspended. Known as --exempt for
    symcli and editStorageGroupActionParam in the PowerMax REST API,
    this capability is available for an SRDF group supporting an active
    SRDF/A session or an active SRDF/Metro session.

    The PowerMax Cinder driver currently uses the exempt flag when
    volumes are added to SRDF groups, but not when volumes are
    removed. This incurs an unnecessary performance penalty that is
    resolved by this change.
