    Added support for NetApp ASA r2 (All-Flash SAN Array r2) disaggregated
    platform in the NetApp unified driver. This introduces a new configuration
    option ``netapp_disaggregated_platform`` that enables ASA r2 specific
    workflows and optimizations.

    The implementation includes:

    * New boolean configuration option ``netapp_disaggregated_platform``
      (default: False) to enable ASA r2 workflows
    * New ``RestClientASAr2`` class that inherits from the standard REST client
    * Override capability for ASA r2 specific functionality when needed
    * Full backward compatibility with existing NetApp ONTAP configurations

    To enable ASA r2 support, set the following in your cinder configuration:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [backend_netapp_asar2]
       volume_driver = cinder.volume.drivers.netapp.common.NetAppDriver
       netapp_storage_family = ontap_cluster
       netapp_storage_protocol = iscsi
       netapp_use_legacy_client = False
       netapp_disaggregated_platform = True
       # ... other NetApp configuration options

    When ``netapp_disaggregated_platform`` is set to ``True``, the driver will:

    * Apply ASA r2 specific optimizations and workflows
    * Maintain full compatibility with existing volume operations
    * Automatically fall back to standard ONTAP behavior when ASA r2 specific
      methods are not available

    The ASA r2 client inherits all functionality from the standard REST client
    by default, with the ability to override individual methods for ASA r2
    specific behavior. This design ensures that:

    * No existing functionality is lost
    * New ASA r2 features will be added incrementally
    * ASAr2 does not support ZAPIs. Hence all the APIs are accessed using REST.

    This feature enables users to take advantage of NetApp's disaggregated
    architecture and ASA r2 specific performance optimizations while
    maintaining a familiar operational experience.
