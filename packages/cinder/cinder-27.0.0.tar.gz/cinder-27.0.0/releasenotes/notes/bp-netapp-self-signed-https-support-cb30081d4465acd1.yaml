    NetApp ONTAP driver: Added support for self-signed certificate
    support for HTTPS transport for management communication between
    Cinder and NetApp ONTAP.

    ONTAP systems utilize self-signed certificates for HTTPS management
    access by default. These certificates are generated automatically
    during the initial setup or deployment of ONTAP. When ssl_cert_path
    is configured with the extracted certificate file (.PEM format),
    Cinder establishes HTTPS communication with full certificate validation.
    When ssl_cert_path is not provided, Cinder automatically uses HTTPS
    with an unverified SSL context, which provides encrypted communication
    but skips certificate validation. This allows secure transport while
    maintaining ease of configuration with ONTAP's default self-signed
    certificates. Administrators can extract the certificate using tools
    such as openssl or curl for full certificate validation if desired.
