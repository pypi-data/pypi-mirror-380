## Install

PyQvd is a Python library available through [pypi](https://pypi.org/). The recommended way to
install and maintain PyQvd as a dependency is through the package installer (PIP). Before
installing this library, download and install Python.

To use PyQvd, first install it using pip:

```bash
(.venv) $ pip install PyQvd
```

## Usage

For a detailed overview of the library's API, please refer to the
[documentation](https://pyqvd.readthedocs.io). Below is a quick example how to use _PyQvd_.

```python
from pyqvd import QvdTable

tbl = QvdTable.from_qvd("path/to/file.qvd")
print(tbl.head())
```

The above example loads the _PyQvd_ library and parses an example QVD file. A QVD file is typically
loaded using the static `QvdTable.from_qvd` function of the `QvdTable` class itself. After loading
the file's content, numerous methods and properties are available to work with the parsed data.
