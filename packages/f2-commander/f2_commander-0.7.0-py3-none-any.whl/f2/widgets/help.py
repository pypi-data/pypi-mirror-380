> Presse any key to close this panel

## Usage

### Interface

 - `Tab`: switch focus between the left and right panels
 - `Ctrl+p`: open the command palette
 - `Ctrl+w`: swap the panels
 - `Ctrl+s`: open the same location in the other panel
 - `?`: show this help
 - `q`: quit the application
 - Keys shown in the footer execute the indicated actions

### Navigation

 - `j`/`k` and `up`/`down`: navigate the list up and down one entry at a time
 - `g`: navigate to the top of the list
 - `G`: navigate to the bottom of the list
 - `Ctrl+f`/`Ctrl+b`, `Ctrl+d`/`Ctrl+u`, `Page Up`/`Page Down`: paginate the list
 - `Enter`: enter the directory or run the default program associated with a
    file type under cursor
 - `Backspace` (or `Enter` on the `..`): navigate up in a directory tree
 - `b`: go to a bookmarked location (see also "Bookmarks configuration" below)
 - `Ctrl+g`: enter a path to jump to
 - `/`: incremental fuzzy search in the list
 - `R`: refresh the file listing
 - `o`: open the current location in the default OS file manager

### Controlling the displayed items

 - `h`: show/hide hidden files
 - `n`/`N`: order the entries by name
 - `s`/`S`: order the entries by size
 - `t`/`T`: order the entries by last modification time
 - `Ctrl+Space`: calculate the size of the directory under cursor

### File and directory manipulation

Most tasks for file and directory manipulation are available in the footer menu.
More tasks are available in the Command Palette (`Ctrl+p`).

According key bindings use mnemonics for the actions:

  - `c`: copy
  - `m`: move
  - etc.

Few exceptions are:

  - `D`: delete (requires upper case `D` to avoid accidental deletions)

Some alternative actions are available with `Shift` key:

  - `Shift-M`: rename a file or directory in place

### Multiple file and directory selection

Some actions, such as copy, move and delete, can be performed on multiple entries.

 - `Space` or `Shift`+`j`/`k`/`up`/`down`: select/unselect an entry under the cursor
 - `-`: clear selection
 - `+`: select all displayed entries
 - `*`: invert selection

### Shell

 - `x` starts (forks) a subprocess with a new shell in the current location.
   Quit the shell to return back to the F2 Commander (e.g., `Ctrl+d` or type and
   execute `exit`).

### Remote file systems (FTP, S3, etc.)

Remote file systems support is in "preview" mode. Most functionality is available,
but bugs are possible.

To connect to a remote file system you may need to **install additional packages**
that are indicated in the "Connect" dialog upon selecting a protocol.

For example, if you installed F2 Commander with `pipx`, and you want to connect
to an S3 bucket, you need to install the `s3fs` package:

    pipx inject f2-commander s3fs

"Connect" dialog is in its "alpha" version, exposing the underlying connector
configuration in a very generic way. Refer to the documentation of the installed
additional packages for more information.

 - `Ctrl+t`: connect to a remote file system

### Remote file systems bookmarks

It is possible to persist a connection for a remote file system, to quickly
reconnect to it without using the connection dialog. See the "Remote file systems"
section in the "Configuration" below.

### Extracting an archive or a compressed file

F2 Comamnder can read and extract archives and compressed files supported by
`libarchive`. A non-exhaustive list includes: ZIP, TAR, XAR, LHA/LZH, ISO 0660
(optical disc files), cpio, mtree, shar, ar, pax, RAR, MS CAB, 7-Zip, WARC, and more.
See https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive for more information.

To view and extract files from from an archive, open it (`Enter`) and copy the files
from it (`c`).

### Creating an archive

To create an archive, select one or multiple files and directories, and run the
"Create an archive" action from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+p`).

Target file extension determines an archival and a compression format. Following
extensions are recognized: `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tbz2`,
`.tar.xz`, `.txz`, `.7z`, `.ar`, `.cpio`, `.warc`.

### Panels

F2 Commander comes with these panel types:

 - Files: default panel type, for file system discovery and manipulation
 - Preview: shows excerpts of the text files selected in the (Files) other panel
 - Help: also invoked with `?` binding, a user manual (this one)

Use `Ctrl+e` and `Ctrl+r` to change the type of the panel on the left and right
respectively.

### Options

Open the configuraiton dialog from a Command Palette or with `Ctrl+,`.

### Themes (colors)

To change the theme, use the configuration dialog (same as above).

Themes are built-in and are not customizable in this version of the application.

## Configuration

A deafult configuration is provided with the application. Your configuration file is:

    {str(user_config_path())}

Or, use "Show the configuration directory" command from the Command Palette to
navigate to it.

Beware: the application may also write to the configuration file as you use it.

### Remote file systems

Connection configuration for remote file systems can be persisted and accessed
from the "Bookmarks" dialog.

Connection configuration is defined under `file_systems`, as a list of connection
objects. Each connection object defines:

 - `display_name`: a title that will be shown in the bookmarks list
 - `protocol`: a name of the protocol recognized by fsspec
 - `path`: an optional default path to navigate to upon connecting (defaults to root)
 - other keys are considered to be fsspec `storage_options`
   (see https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#fsspec.filesystem)

Refer to the documentation of the installed additional packages for more information
about the remote file system configuration.

For example, to connect to an ADLS Gen2 storage account:

    file_systems = [
      {{
        "display_name": "My BLOB storage",
        "protocol": "abfs",
        "params": {{
          "account_name": "myaccount",
          "account_key": "mykey"
        }}
      }}
    ]

To connect to a remote file system you may need to install additional packages that
provide `fsspec` implementations for the desired protocol. To find the name of the
package, if it is missing, use the "Connect" dialog (`Ctrl+t`).

For example, if you installed F2 Commander with `pipx`, and you want to connect
to an S3 bucket, you need to install the `s3fs` package:

    pipx inject f2-commander s3fs
