# Internal Documentation

This directory contains internal documentation for PicTex developers and maintainers.

## Purpose

Internal docs serve a different audience than public documentation:

- **Public docs** (`docs/`) focus on helping users accomplish their goals
- **Internal docs** (`docs/internal/`) focus on maintaining consistency and understanding architectural decisions

## Contents

- **[Design Decisions](design-decisions.md)**: Rationale behind non-obvious behaviors and architectural choices
- **[Architecture Notes](architecture.md)**: High-level system design and component interactions *(future)*
- **[Development Guidelines](development.md)**: Internal coding standards and practices *(future)*

## When to Add Internal Documentation

Consider documenting internally when:

1. **A design decision has trade-offs** that aren't obvious
2. **Behavior might seem counterintuitive** to future developers
3. **Multiple approaches were considered** and one was chosen for specific reasons
4. **Implementation details affect public API** in subtle ways
5. **Consistency patterns** need to be maintained across features

## Guidelines

- **Focus on "why"**, not "how" (code should be self-documenting for "how")
- **Include examples** that illustrate the decision
- **Note alternatives considered** and rejection reasons
- **Keep it concise** but thorough
- **Update when decisions change** or evolve

This documentation helps maintain the library's conceptual integrity as it grows.
