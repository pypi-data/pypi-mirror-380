# LUKS Tray

**luks-tray** is a GTK-based tray utility for managing ad hoc LUKS-encrypted files: mount and unmount with ease from your Linux desktop environment.


## Features

- **System tray integration** - Simple click-to-mount/unmount interface for LUKS devices and files
- **Visual status indicators** - Symbols mounted (‚ñ£), unmounted (‚ñΩ), and open-but-unmounted (‚Äº) states
- **File container support** - Add, create, and manage LUKS file containers from the tray.
- **Mount point history** - Remembers previous mount locations for convenience and clarity
- **Background monitoring** - Automatically detects newly inserted devices with LUKS containers
- **Password management** - Optional master password to encrypt stored credentials

## Quick Start

1. Install and run `luks-tray`.  Use `pipx` to install, update and remove; e.g. `pipx install luks-tray`. See [pipx docs](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for more details.
2. Click the tray icon to see available containers. You may:
    - Insert a disk with LUKS devices to detect them automatically.
    - Add an existing or create a new encrypted file to manage it.
4. Click a ‚ñΩ container to mount it; or a ‚ñ£/‚Äº container to unmount it.
5. When mounting a container, enter its password and choose mount point in the dialog
    - if the app has a mount point in its history, it will fill in that mount point
    - otherwise, the app will generate a mount point in `~/Vaults`

## Visual Interface

The tray icon is shaped like a shield changes based on container states:
- <img src="https://github.com/joedefen/luks-tray/raw/main/luks_tray/resources/white-shield-v04.svg" alt="White Shield Icon" width="24" height="24"> - All containers are locked and unmounted (i.e., all data is secure).
- <img src="https://github.com/joedefen/luks-tray/raw/main/luks_tray/resources/alert-shield-v04.svg" alt="Alert Shield Icon" width="24" height="24"> - Some containers are unlocked but unmounted (i.e., one or more anomalies).
- <img src="https://github.com/joedefen/luks-tray/raw/main/luks_tray/resources/green-shield-v04.svg" alt="Green Shield Icon" width="24" height="24"> - Some containers are mounted w/o any anomalies (i.e., some of the encrypted data is available)

Here is an sample menu as seen when you right-click the tray shield icon:

Notes:

- the first section shows LUKS devices, and the second shows LUKS files.
- click a ‚ñ£ entry to dismount and lock a mounted, unlocked LUKS container

  - if busy, you are shown the PIDs and names of processes preventing dismount

- click a ‚ñΩ entry to unlock and mount a locked LUKS container
- click a ‚Äº entry to lock an unmounted, unlocked container (considered an anomaly)
- or click of the action lines to perform the described action
- LUKS devices must be created with other tools such as Gnome Disks.
- LUKS files are only automatically detected in its history; when you add or create new LUKS files, they are added to the history.
- When creating LUKS files, the default folder is `~/.Crypts`.
- When mounting LUKS files for the first time, the default folder is `~/Crypts/{basename}` where `{basename}` is the basename of the encrypted LUKS file (less any `.luks`, `.luks2`, or `.crypt` suffix).



## Configuration

Settings and data files are stored in `~/.config/luks-tray/`:
- **History file** - Stored of passwords and mount preferences; it is encrypted when the master password enabled.
- **INI file** - the default .ini file looks like:

      [ui]
      show_passwords_by_default = True
      show_anomaly_alerts = True
      auto_mount_folder = ~/Vaults

  You can thus change
    - whether passwords are shown by default when being first entered.
    - whether ‚ÄºÔ∏è entries (i.e., anomalies) cause the tray icon to change to the alert shield.
    - where the automatically generated mount points live

## Security Notes

- Passwords are only stored when master password feature is enabled
- History file is encrypted using the master password
- System mount points are excluded by default to prevent interference with disk encryption
- When creating LUKS file containers, password strength is not enforced; use due care.

---
## Limitations

- **Not for whole disk encryption** - Excludes system mount points like `/`, `/home`, `/var` to avoid interfering with boot-time encrypted volumes
- **No udisks2 integration** - May not always play nicely with desktop auto-mounting tools; so mount and unmount containers with the same tool for the best results.
- **Loop device requirement** - File containers require `lsblk` to show them as loop devices (standard on most distros)
- **Single filesystem focus** - Containers with multiple filesystems are out of scope of this tool and get very limited support (i.e., mostly handling only the first filesystem).

## Requirements
#### Additional System Utilities may be Needed
This program requires `cryptsetup`, `fuser`, and other system utilities. After install, run `luks-tray --check-deps` to get a report on what dependencies are found and missing. If any are missing, install those using your distro package manager.

    
#### Passwordless `sudo` Setup (Required)

To allow the tray app to manage LUKS containers without prompting for your password each time, configure passwordless `sudo` for specific commands. For example, in a terminal, run `sudo visudo`, and then add this line at the end of the file (replacing {yourusername} with your actual username):

    {yourusername} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

üí° This grants your user passwordless access to all commands. You may be able to limit it to just the `luks-tray` app or subset of commands. See `man sudoers` for details.

#### A Working System Tray
It works best with DEs/WMs that offer **first-class tray support**, such as:

  - **KDE Plasma**
  - **Sway** with **waybar**
  - **i3wm** with **polybar**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **GNOME**: Requires a third-party extension (such as AppIndicator support) to show tray icons. Results may vary across GNOME versions.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Xfce** and similar lightweight DEs: Tray menus may open off-screen or be partially cut off, depending on panel layout and screen resolution.

Test Notes:
  - for no filesystems:
    - sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test_luks_container bs=1M count=100
    - sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /tmp/test_luks_container
    - sudo cryptsetup open /tmp/test_luks_container test_luks
  - for two file systems:
    - sudo pvcreate /dev/mapper/test_luks
    - sudo vgcreate test_vg /dev/mapper/test_luks
    - sudo lvcreate -L 20M -n lv1 test_vg
    - sudo lvcreate -L 20M -n lv2 test_vg
    - sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/test_vg/lv1
    - sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/test_vg/lv2
