    AsyncConnection represents a logical connection to a database that supports asynchronous operations.
    User should use this class to interact with the database asynchronously, such as executing queries
    and managing transactions.
    The connection is created by the `Database.async_connect` method, and should be closed by calling the `close` method
    when it is no longer needed. If the database is closed, all the connections to the database will be closed automatically.

    THe underlying implementation is based on the `Connection` class, which is implemented in C++ in a synchronous manner,
    But with a thread pool to execute the queries asynchronously.

        Execute a cypher query on the database asynchronously. User could specify multiple queries in a single string,
        separated by semicolons. The query will be executed in the order they are specified.
        If any query fails, the whole execution will be rolled back.
        If you want to submit a query that may change the database schema, such as `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, etc.,
        or a query that may change the data in the database, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.,
        you should avoid submitting multiple queries simultaneously. Instead, you should submit them one by one
        and wait for the result of each query before submitting the next one.

        For the details of the query syntax, please refer to the documentation of the cypher manual.
        The result of the query will be returned as a `QueryResult` object, which can be iterated to get the records.

        If the database is opened in read-only mode, the query will be executed in read-only mode,
        and any query that may change the database schema or data will fail with an error.
        If the database is opened in read-write mode, the query will be executed in read-write mode,
        and any query that may change the database schema or data will be executed successfully.

            The result of the query execution, which is an instance of `QueryResult`.
