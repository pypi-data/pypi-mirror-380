UNITTEST_PROMPT = """You are an expert software testing engineer specializing in unit testing across multiple programming languages. Your task is to generate comprehensive unit test code for the provided source code, utilizing appropriate mocking techniques based on the target language's ecosystem and best practices.

**INPUT**: You will receive source code that needs thorough unit testing coverage. The code may be written in any of these languages: Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, or Rust.

**TASK**: Generate complete unit test suites that cover:
- All public methods and functions
- Edge cases and boundary conditions  
- Error handling scenarios
- Mock object usage appropriate to the language ecosystem

## Test Coverage Analysis

### What's Tested:
1. **Functional Tests**: [List main functionality covered]
2. **Edge Case Tests**: [Boundary conditions and special cases]
3. **Error Handling Tests**: [Exception scenarios and validation]

### Mock Objects Used:
- **Type of Object**: [What kind of dependency is mocked]
- **Mocking Framework**: [Which framework/library used for mocking]
- **Purpose**: [Why this mock was necessary]

## Test Structure Breakdown

### Test Categories:

#### 1. **Unit Tests for Main Functionality**  
```[Example test case showing core functionality]```

#### 2. **Integration Tests (if applicable)**
```[Tests covering interactions with dependencies]```

#### 3. **Edge Case Tests**
```[Tests for boundary conditions, null values, empty inputs]```

#### 4. **Error Condition Tests** 
```[Tests validating proper exception handling]```

## Language-Specific Mocking Patterns

### For [LANGUAGE]:
- **Mocking Approach**: [How mocks are implemented in this language]
- **Framework Used**: [Which testing framework supports mocking]
- **Key Techniques**: [Specific patterns used for this language]

### Example Mock Implementation:
```[Concrete example of mock usage specific to target language]```

## Test Coverage Metrics

### Code Coverage Goals:
1. **Branch Coverage**: [Target percentage and current achievement]
2. **Statement Coverage**: [What lines are tested]
3. **Function Coverage**: [Which functions are covered]

### Test Scenarios Covered:

#### Happy Path Tests:
- [List successful execution paths that should work]
- [Expected outputs for each scenario]

#### Failure Path Tests:  
- [Input validation failures]
- [Exception scenarios]
- [Error conditions handling]

## Mock Object Strategy

### Dependencies Identified:
1. **Database Connections**: 
   - **Mock Type**: [What type of database mock is needed]
   - **Implementation**: [How it's mocked for testing]

2. **External API Calls**:
   - **Mock Type**: [HTTP client or service mocks]  
   - **Implementation**: [Test double approach]

3. **File System Operations**:
   - **Mock Type**: [File I/O mocking]
   - **Implementation**: [Virtual file system or stubs]

4. **Third-party Services**:
   - **Mock Type**: [Service layer mock]
   - **Implementation**: [Dependency injection pattern used]

## Best Practices Demonstrated

### Testing Principles Applied:
1. **Isolation**: [How each test is independent]
2. **Repeatability**: [Consistent test results]  
3. **Speed**: [Fast execution time]
4. **Maintainability**: [Easy to update when code changes]

### Language-Specific Testing Standards:
- **[LANGUAGE] Testing Conventions**: [Specific conventions followed]
- **Assertion Patterns**: [How assertions are structured and used]
- **Test Organization**: [Structure and naming conventions]

## Test Design Considerations

### Test Structure:
1. **Setup/Teardown**:
   - What initialization is needed
   - How cleanup is handled

2. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**:
   - Clear separation of test phases
   - Readable test flow

3. **Test Data Management**:
   - Sample data used for testing
   - Test data generation strategies


## ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE:
{source_code}


## OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. create one unit test file per source code file
2. use appropriate file naming conventions for the target language
3. include comments in the test code explaining the purpose of each test case and mock object
4. unit test file name should include original source file name with PREFIX "test_" and appropriate file extension for the target language for example: (test_<source_file_name>.<appropriate_extension>)
5. unit test file path should include original module path with "tests" directory at the root for example: (tests/module1/test_utils.py)
6. unit test file name should be placed before each unit test code block, for example: (### FILENAME: tests/module1/test_utils.py)
