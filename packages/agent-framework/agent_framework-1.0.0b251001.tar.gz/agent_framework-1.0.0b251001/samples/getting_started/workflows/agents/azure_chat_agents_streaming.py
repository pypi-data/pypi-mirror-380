Sample: Agents in a workflow with streaming

A Writer agent generates content, then a Reviewer agent critiques it.
The workflow uses streaming so you can observe incremental AgentRunUpdateEvent chunks as each agent produces tokens.

Purpose:
Show how to wire chat agents directly into a WorkflowBuilder pipeline where agents are auto wrapped as executors.

Demonstrate:
- Automatic streaming of agent deltas via AgentRunUpdateEvent.
- A simple console aggregator that groups updates by executor id and prints them as they arrive.
- The workflow completes when idle and outputs are available in events.get_outputs().

Prerequisites:
- Azure OpenAI configured for AzureOpenAIChatClient with required environment variables.
- Authentication via azure-identity. Use AzureCliCredential and run az login before executing the sample.
- Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, edges, events, and streaming runs.
