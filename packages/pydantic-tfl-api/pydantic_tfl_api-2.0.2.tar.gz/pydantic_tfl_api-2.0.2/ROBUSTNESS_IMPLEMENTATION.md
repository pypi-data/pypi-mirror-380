## Active Development Phases

### Phase 3: Intelligent Dependency Management

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: High

**Goal**: Configure Renovate to automatically manage dependencies with appropriate merge strategies for dev vs. production dependencies.

**Strategy**:
- **Dev Dependencies & Actions**: Auto-merge after tests pass (pytest, ruff, mypy, GitHub Actions)
- **Production Dependencies**: Create PRs for review, widen version ranges where possible (pydantic, requests)
- **Security Patches**: Auto-merge all security updates regardless of type
- **Version Testing**: Existing Pydantic version matrix (2.8.2, latest) provides adequate coverage

**Tasks**:
- [x] Update `renovate.json` with intelligent grouping and automerge rules
- [x] Configure separate rules for dev vs. prod dependencies
- [x] Add GitHub Actions auto-merge with digest pinning
- [x] Test Renovate configuration with dry-run
- [x] Document dependency update strategy (see `docs/DEPENDENCY_STRATEGY.md`)

**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (UV)
**Blockers**: None

### Phase 5: Automated Build & Release Pipeline

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: High
**Completed**: 2025-09-30

**Goal**: Fully automate spec fetching, diffing, versioning, and releases with semantic versioning and release branch isolation.

**Current State**:
- ✅ `fetch_tfl_specs.py` script exists
- ✅ Automated spec monitoring with weekly scheduling
- ✅ Spec comparison via rebuild-and-diff strategy
- ✅ Complete release branch workflow

**Sub-Phases**:

#### 5a. Automated Spec Monitoring
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/fetch_tfl_specs.yml` (weekly cron + manual trigger)
- [x] Add spec comparison/diff logic to detect meaningful changes via `scripts/compare_specs.py`
- [x] Implement auto-PR creation for spec updates with detailed change summaries
- [x] Add spec versioning metadata (timestamp, hash, change summary)
- [x] Validate against all 14+ APIs
- [x] Strategy: Rebuild models and use git diff for accurate change detection

#### 5b. Release Branch Strategy
- [x] Create `.github/workflows/sync_release.yml` for release branch management
- [x] Workflow creates `release` branch from `main` on first run
- [x] Automated main → release sync on every push to main
- [x] Update `deploy_workflow_wrapper.yml` to deploy from release branch only
- [x] Created reusable `bump_version.yml` workflow for version management
- [x] Documentation in CONTRIBUTING.md includes release process and hotfix procedure

**Note**: Branch protection rules must be configured manually via GitHub UI:
- Settings > Branches > Add branch protection rule
- Branch pattern: `release`
- Enable: Require pull request reviews, status checks, up-to-date branches
- See `.github/workflows/sync_release.yml` for detailed setup instructions

#### 5c. Semantic Versioning & Release Notes
- [x] Define commit message convention (conventional commits standard)
- [x] Configure automatic version detection based on dependency changes:
  - Production dependency major bump → major version bump
  - Production dependency minor bump → minor version bump
  - Production dependency patch bump → patch version bump
- [x] GitHub releases will include:
  - Automated release notes
  - Breaking changes highlighted
  - Link to full CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Versions managed via automated dependency-based detection in workflows

**Workflow**:
```
Development:  PR → main (tests run)
              ↓
Release:      Weekly/on-demand sync → release branch
              ↓
              Semantic version bump
              ↓
              Build → Test → Deploy to PyPI
              ↓
              GitHub Release with notes
```

**Dependencies**: Phase 3
**Blockers**: None

- Generate .pyi stub files for better IDE support
- Extract docstrings from OpenAPI specs
- Enhance ApiError with more context
- Add field deprecation warnings

**Dependencies**: Phase 5
**Blockers**: None

### Phase 9: Documentation

**Status**: 🔴 Not Started
**Priority**: Low (As needed)

**Planned Documentation**:
- CONTRIBUTING.md with development workflow
- Commit message conventions
- Release process documentation
- API usage examples
- Troubleshooting guide

**Dependencies**: Phase 5
**Blockers**: None

## Key Architecture Decisions

### Dependency Strategy
- **Range Strategy**: `widen` for production deps to maximize compatibility
- **Dev Dependencies**: Aggressive auto-merge to stay current with tooling
- **Security**: Always auto-merge security patches
- **Testing**: Pydantic min/max matrix ensures compatibility across range

### Release Strategy
- **Branch Model**: `main` for development, `release` for production deployments
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning based on conventional commits
- **Cadence**: Weekly automated spec checks, on-demand releases for features
- **Quality Gates**: All tests + type checking + linting must pass before release

### Spec Management
- **Monitoring**: Weekly automated fetches from TfL API portal
- **Change Detection**: Semantic diff to identify breaking vs. non-breaking changes
- **Response**: Auto-PR for review, manual approval for spec updates
- **Versioning**: Track spec timestamps and hashes for audit trail

- ✅ `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Comprehensive development and release process documentation

---

## Next Steps

**Completed**: ✅ Phase 3 (Dependency Management) - Complete
**Completed**: ✅ Phase 5 (Build & Release Pipeline) - Complete

**Immediate Actions Required**:
1. **Merge feature branch** `feature/automated-build-release-pipeline` to `main`
2. **Install pre-commit hooks**: Run `uv run pre-commit install`
3. **Sync dependencies**: Run `uv sync --all-extras --dev`
4. **Configure branch protection** for `release` branch (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
5. **Trigger release branch creation**: Workflow will auto-create on first sync

**Phase 8: Code Generation Enhancements** ✅ Completed (2025-09-30):
- ✅ Extract docstrings from OpenAPI specs (class and field descriptions)
- ✅ Field descriptions in `Field(description="...")` for IDE tooltip support
- ✅ Enhanced ApiError with debugging context (request/response details, retry count, error category)
- ✅ Confirmed Pydantic v2 uses `__slots__` internally (memory optimization built-in)
- ✅ 370 tests passing with 94.88% coverage
- ⏭️ Skipped: .pyi stub files (generated code already has complete type annotations)
- ⏭️ Skipped: Deprecation warnings (TfL specs don't mark fields as deprecated)

## Notes

### Available TfL APIs
Total of 14+ APIs currently implemented from TfL API portal. Six additional APIs discovered but not yet integrated.

### Key Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: TfL API breaking changes
  - **Mitigation**: Weekly monitoring, semantic diffing, review process before merge
- **Risk**: Dependency conflicts from aggressive auto-merge
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite, separate rules for prod deps
- **Risk**: Release branch drift
  - **Mitigation**: Automated sync workflow, branch protection rules
