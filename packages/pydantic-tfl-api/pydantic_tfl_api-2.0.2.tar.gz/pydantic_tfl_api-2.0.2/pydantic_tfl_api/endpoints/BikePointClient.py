    def GetAll(self, ) -> ResponseModel[PlaceArray] | ApiError:
        '''
        Gets all bike point locations. The Place object has an addtionalProperties array which contains the nbBikes, nbDocks and nbSpaces
            numbers which give the status of the BikePoint. A mismatch in these numbers i.e. nbDocks - (nbBikes + nbSpaces) != 0 indicates broken docks.

  Query path: `/BikePoint/`

  `ResponseModel.content` contains `models.PlaceArray` type.


  Parameters:
        No parameters required.

    def Get(self, id: str) -> ResponseModel[Place] | ApiError:
        '''
        Gets the bike point with the given id.

  Query path: `/BikePoint/{id}`

  `ResponseModel.content` contains `models.Place` type.


  Parameters:
    `id`: str - A bike point id (a list of ids can be obtained from the above BikePoint call). Example: `BikePoints_583`

    def Search(self, query: str) -> ResponseModel[PlaceArray] | ApiError:
        '''
        Search for bike stations by their name, a bike point's name often contains information about the name of the street
            or nearby landmarks, for example. Note that the search result does not contain the PlaceProperties i.e. the status
            or occupancy of the BikePoint, to get that information you should retrieve the BikePoint by its id on /BikePoint/id.

  Query path: `/BikePoint/Search`

  `ResponseModel.content` contains `models.PlaceArray` type.


  Parameters:
    `query`: str - The search term e.g. "St. James". Example: `London`

        return self._send_request_and_deserialize(base_url, endpoints['BikePoint_Search'], endpoint_args={ 'query': query })
