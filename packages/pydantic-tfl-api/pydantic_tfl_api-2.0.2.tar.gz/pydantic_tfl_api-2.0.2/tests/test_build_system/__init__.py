"""Tests for the refactored build system classes.

This package contains comprehensive tests for each component of the refactored
build system:

- test_model_builder: Tests for ModelBuilder class
- test_dependency_resolver: Tests for DependencyResolver class
- test_file_manager: Tests for FileManager class
- test_spec_processor: Tests for SpecProcessor class
- test_client_generator: Tests for ClientGenerator class
- test_build_coordinator: Tests for BuildCoordinator class

These tests define the expected interfaces and behaviors that the refactored
classes must implement to maintain compatibility with the existing build system.
