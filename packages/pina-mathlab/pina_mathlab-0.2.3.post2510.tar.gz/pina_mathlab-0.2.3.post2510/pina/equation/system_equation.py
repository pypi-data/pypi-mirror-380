class SystemEquation(EquationInterface):
    """
    Implementation of the System of Equations, to be passed to a
    :class:`~pina.condition.condition.Condition` object.

    Unlike the :class:`~pina.equation.equation.Equation` class, which represents
    a single equation, the :class:`SystemEquation` class allows multiple
    equations to be grouped together into a system. This is particularly useful
    when dealing with multi-component outputs or coupled physical models, where
    the residual must be computed collectively across several constraints.

    Each equation in the system must be either:
    - An instance of :class:`~pina.equation.equation.Equation`;
    - A callable function.

    The residuals from each equation are computed independently and then
    aggregated using an optional reduction strategy (e.g., ``mean``, ``sum``).
    The resulting residual is returned as a single :class:`~pina.LabelTensor`.

    :Example:

    >>> from pina.equation import SystemEquation, FixedValue, FixedGradient
    >>> from pina import LabelTensor
    >>> import torch
    >>> pts = LabelTensor(torch.rand(10, 2), labels=["x", "y"])
    >>> pts.requires_grad = True
    >>> output_ = torch.pow(pts, 2)
    >>> output_.labels = ["u", "v"]
    >>> system_equation = SystemEquation(
    ...     [
    ...         FixedValue(value=1.0, components=["u"]),
    ...         FixedGradient(value=0.0, components=["v"],d=["y"]),
    ...     ],
    ...     reduction="mean",
    ... )
    >>> residual = system_equation.residual(pts, output_)
