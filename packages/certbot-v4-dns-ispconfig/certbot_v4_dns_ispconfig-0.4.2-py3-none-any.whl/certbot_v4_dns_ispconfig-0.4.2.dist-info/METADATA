              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

certbot-dns-ispconfig
=====================

ISPConfig_ DNS Authenticator plugin for Certbot v5.0+

.. note::
   This code was forked from the original certbot-dns-ispconfig plugin https://github.com/m42e/certbot-dns-ispconfig, and was quickly updated with the help from an AI (Cursor) to work with Certbot v4.2.0+ due to the original author not responding to issues and requests for updates in a timely manner.
   
   Tested working with at least certbot v4.2 and v5.0 and ispconfig v3.3.0.

This plugin automates the process of completing a ``dns-01`` challenge by
creating, and subsequently removing, TXT records using the ISPConfig Remote API.

Configuration of ISPConfig
---------------------------

In the `System -> Remote Users` you have to have a user, with the following rights

- Client Functions
- DNS zone functions
- DNS txt functions


.. _ISPConfig: https://www.ispconfig.org/

Installation
------------

::

    pip install certbot-v4-dns-ispconfig


Named Arguments
---------------

To start using DNS authentication for ispconfig, pass the following arguments on
certbot's command line:

- ``--authenticator dns-ispconfig`` - select the authenticator plugin (Required)
- ``--dns-ispconfig-credentials`` - ispconfig Remote User credentials INI file. (Required)  
- ``--dns-ispconfig-propagation-seconds`` - waiting time for DNS to propagate before asking the ACME server to verify the DNS record. (Default: 120, Recommended: >= 600)

.. note::
   The verbose and seemingly redundant ``certbot-dns-ispconfig:`` prefix is currently imposed by certbot for external plugins.


Credentials
-----------

An example ``credentials.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

   dns_ispconfig_username = myremoteuser
   dns_ispconfig_password = verysecureremoteuserpassword
   dns_ispconfig_endpoint = https://you.ipsconfig.host:8080/remote/json.php

The path to this file can be provided interactively or using the
``--dns-ispconfig-credentials`` command-line argument. Certbot
records the path to this file for use during renewal, but does not store the
file's contents.

**CAUTION:** You should protect these API credentials as you would the
password to your ispconfig account. Users who can read this file can use these
credentials to issue arbitrary API calls on your behalf. Users who can cause
Certbot to run using these credentials can complete a ``dns-01`` challenge to
acquire new certificates or revoke existing certificates for associated
domains, even if those domains aren't being managed by this server.

Certbot will emit a warning if it detects that the credentials file can be
accessed by other users on your system. The warning reads "Unsafe permissions
on credentials configuration file", followed by the path to the credentials
file. This warning will be emitted each time Certbot uses the credentials file,
including for renewal, and cannot be silenced except by addressing the issue
(e.g., by using a command like ``chmod 600`` to restrict access to the file).


Examples
--------

To acquire a single certificate for both ``example.com`` and
``*.example.com``, waiting 900 seconds for DNS propagation:

.. code-block:: bash

   certbot certonly \
     --authenticator dns-ispconfig \
     --dns-ispconfig-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets/domain.tld.ini \
     --dns-ispconfig-propagation-seconds 900 \
     --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
     --agree-tos \
     --rsa-key-size 4096 \
     -d 'example.com' \
     -d '*.example.com'


Docker
------

In order to create a docker container with a certbot-dns-ispconfig installation,
create an empty directory with the following ``Dockerfile``:

.. code-block:: docker

    FROM certbot/certbot
    RUN pip install certbot-v4-dns-ispconfig

Proceed to build the image::

    docker build -t certbot/dns-ispconfig .

Once that's finished, the application can be run as follows::

    docker run --rm \
       -v /var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt \
       -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
       --cap-drop=all \
       certbot/dns-ispconfig certonly \
       --authenticator dns-ispconfig \
       --dns-ispconfig-propagation-seconds 900 \
       --dns-ispconfig-credentials \
           /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets/domain.tld.ini \
       --no-self-upgrade \
       --keep-until-expiring --non-interactive --expand \
       --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
       -d example.com -d '*.example.com'

It is suggested to secure the folder as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    chown root:root /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets
    chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets
