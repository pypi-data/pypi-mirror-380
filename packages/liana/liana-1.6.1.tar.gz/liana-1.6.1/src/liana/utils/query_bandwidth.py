    Query the bandwidth (maximum distance) at which the average number of neighbors is maximized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates
        Spatial coordinates of spots.
    start
        Starting bandwidth.
    end
        Ending bandwidth.
    interval_n
        Number of bandwidths to query. Used to generate a linearly spaced interval between `start` and `end`.
        Default is 50.
    reference
        Reference coordinates to query the neighbors from. Default is `None`, which will use `coordinates`.

    Returns
    -------
    A `plotnine` plot and a `pandas` DataFrame with the following columns:
        - `bandwith`: the bandwidth (maximum distance) at which the average number of neighbors is maximized.
        - `neighbours`: the average number of neighbors at the specified bandwidth.
