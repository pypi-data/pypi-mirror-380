class AsyncInvocationTask(AsyncTask):
    """
    Handles asynchronous invocation tasks, designed to process events with
    specific handlers and generate immediate responses.

    The class is aimed at enabling tasks to be processed asynchronously, involving
    a handler factory and functions for event processing and post-processing. It
    executes operations in a background thread pool to ensure quick response to
    clients, allowing them to poll for job status updates. Its primary purpose is
    to facilitate efficient asynchronous processing of jobs without blocking the
    main application flow.

    Attributes:
        handler_factory: Factory instance that produces job handlers.
        event: Event to be processed by the created handler.
        processing_fn: Function to be executed during the job processing stage.
        post_processing_fn: Function to be executed post-job processing.
