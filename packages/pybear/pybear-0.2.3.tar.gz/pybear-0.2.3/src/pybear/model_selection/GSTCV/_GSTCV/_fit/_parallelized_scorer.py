    # dont adjust the spacing, is congruent with train scorer

    """Using the estimators fit on each train fold, use `predict_proba`
    and _X_test to generate _y_preds and score against the corresponding
    _y_tests using all of the scorers and thresholds.

    Builds one fold layer of the TEST_FOLD_x_THRESHOLD_x_SCORER__SCORE
    and TEST_FOLD_x_THRESHOLD_x_SCORER__SCORE_TIME cubes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    _X_test : SKXType
        A test partition of the data, matched up with the estimator that
        was trained on the complementary train set.
    _y_test : SKYType
        The corresponding test partition of the target for the X test
        partition.
    _FIT_OUTPUT_TUPLE : tuple[ClassifierProtocol, float, bool]
        A tuple holding the fitted estimator, the fit time (not needed
        here), and the fit_excepted boolean (needed here.)
    _f_idx : int
        The zero-based split index of the test partition used here;
        parallelism occurs over the different splits.
    _SCORER_DICT : ScorerWIPType
        A dictionary with scorer name as keys and the scorer callables
        as values. The scorer callables are scoring metrics (or similar),
        not 'make_scorer'.
    _THRESHOLDS : ThresholdsWIPType
        For the current search permutation, there was a mother param
        grid that contained a 'thresholds' parameter, that was separated
        from the mother before building `cv_results_`. This is the vector
        of thresholds from the mother that also mothered this search
        permutation.
    _error_score : numbers.Real | Literal['raise']
        If the training fold complementing this test fold excepted during
        fitting and `error_score` was set to the 'raise' literal, this
        module cannot be reached. Otherwise, a number or number-like was
        passed to `error_score`. If 'fit_excepted' is True, this module
        puts the `error_score` value in every position of the
        TEST_THRESHOLD_x_SCORER__SCORE_LAYER array. If `error_score` is
        set to np.nan, that layer is also masked. Every value in
        TEST_THRESHOLD_x_SCORER__SCORE_TIME_LAYER is set to np.nan and
        masked.
    _verbose : int
        A number from 0 to 10 that indicates the amount of information
        to display to the screen during the grid search process. 0 means
        no output, 10 means maximum output.

    Returns
    -------
    __ : tuple[MaskedHolderType, MaskedHolderType]
        TEST_THRESHOLD_x_SCORER__SCORE_LAYER : MaskedHolderType
            Masked array of shape (n_thresholds, n_scorers) holding the
            scores for each scorer on each threshold for one fold of test
            data.

        TEST_THRESHOLD_x_SCORER__SCORE_TIME_LAYER: MaskedHolderType
            Masked array of shape (n_thresholds, n_scorers) holding the
            times to score each scorer on each threshold for one fold of
            test data.
