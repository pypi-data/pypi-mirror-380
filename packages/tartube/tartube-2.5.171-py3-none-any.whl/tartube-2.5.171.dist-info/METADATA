Tartube is a GUI front-end for youtube-dl, yt-dlp and other compatible video
downloaders.
.
 - You can fetch a list of videos from your favourite channels and playlists on
 YouTube, BitChute, and hundreds of other websites
 - In buffering is an issue, you can download a temporary copy of a video
 before automatically opening it in your favourite media player
 - Tartube will organise your videos into convenient folders (if that's what
 you want)
 - Tartube can alert you when livestreams and debut videos are starting
 (YouTube only)
 - If you think the censors will remove a video, against the wishes of its
 creators and before you've had a chance to watch it, Tartube can make an
 archive copy
 - Tartube won't manipulate search results, unsubscribe you from your favourite
 channels or deliberately conceal videos
 - Tartube is free and open-source software
