1 Introduction
==============

**Tartube** is a GUI front-end for `youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__, `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__ and other compatible video downloaders.

It is written in Python 3 / Gtk 3 and runs on MS Windows, Linux, BSD and MacOS.

Problems can be reported at `our GitHub page <https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues>`__.

2 Why should I use Tartube?
===========================

- You can fetch a list of videos from your favourite channels on `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/>`__, `Twitch <https://www.twitch.tv/>`__, `Odysee <https://odysee.com/>`__ and hundreds of other sites (see `here <https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html>`__ or `here <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md>`__ for a full list)
- If buffering is an issue, you can download a temporary copy of a video before automatically opening it in your favourite media player
- **Tartube** will organise your videos into convenient folders (if that's what you want)
- **Tartube** can alert you when livestreams and debut videos are starting (works on **YouTube**, **Twitch** and **Odysee** by default)
- If creators upload their videos to more than one website (**YouTube** and **BitChute**, for example), **Tartube** can interact with both sites without creating duplicates
- Certain sites operate an "only one opinion allowed" policy. If you think that the censors will remove a video, against the wishes of its creators and before you've had a chance to watch it, **Tartube** can make an archive copy
- Certain sites manipulate search results, repeatedly unsubscribe people from their favourite channels and/or deliberately conceal videos that they don't like. **Tartube** won't do any of those things
- If you want to listen to your favourite discussion videos, for example while driving a car, **Tartube** can make an archive copy of just the audio, rather than the full video
- **Tartube** is free and open-source software

4 Quick start guide
===================

- Install **Tartube**, using any of the methods described below
- Start **Tartube**. A setup window should appear
- When prompted, choose a folder in which **Tartube** can store videos
- When prompted, choose a downloader
- On some systems, you will be prompted to install the downloader and/or `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__. On other systems, you will have to install them yourself

Tartube can store its videos in a database. If that's what you want, then do this:

- Go to a `video website <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_video_platforms>`__, and find your favourite channel
- In **Tartube**'s main window, click the **Add a new channel** button (or from the menu, click **Media > Add channel...** )
- In the dialogue window, add the name of the channel and its URL (link)
- Click the **OK** button to close the window
- Click the **Check all** button. **Tartube** will fetch a list of videos in the channel
- Click **All Videos** to see that list
- If you want to download the videos, click the **Download all** button

If you just want to download videos with a minimum of fuss, do this:

- Go to a `video website <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_video_platforms>`__, and find your favourite channel
- In **Tartube**'s main window, click the **Classic Mode** tab
- Copy the URL (link) to the channel into the box at the top of tab
- Just below that, click the button to select a download destination and a video/audio format
- Click the **Add URLs** button
- When you're ready, click the **Download all** button

5 Installation
==============

5.1 Installation - MS Windows
-----------------------------

MS Windows users should use the installer `available at the Tartube website <https://tartube.sourceforge.io/>`__. The installer contains everything you need to run **Tartube**.

There is also a portable edition; use this if you want to install **Tartube** onto removable media, such as a USB drive. Download the ZIP file, extract it, and run the file **tartube_portable_64bit.bat**.

Both the installer and the portable edition include a copy of `AtomicParsley <https://bitbucket.org/jonhedgerows/atomicparsley/wiki/Home>`__, so there is no need to install it yourself.

Tartube is no longer supported on older versions of MS Windows - see `7.24 Doesn't work on 32-bit Windows / Windows 7 / Windows 8`_.

5.1.1 Manual installation - MS Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to perform a manual installation, you can follow this procedure, which will take about 10-30 minutes, depending on your network speed.

- Download and install MSYS2 from `msys2.org <https://msys2.org>`__. You need the file that looks something like **msys2-x86_64-yyyymmdd.exe**
- MSYS2 wants to install in **C:\\msys64**, so do that
- Open the MINGW64 terminal, which is **C:\\msys64\\mingw64.exe**
- In the MINGW64 terminal, type:

        **pacman -Syu**

- If the terminal wants to shut down, close it, and then restart it
- Now type the following commands, one by one:

        **pacman -Su**

        **pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3**

        **pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pip**

        **pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-gobject**

        **pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-requests**

        **pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3**

        **pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gsettings-desktop-schemas**

- (Don't close the MINGW64 terminal until you have finished the manual installation)
- Install Microsoft Visual C++ (a free download from the Microsoft website)
- Navigate to the folder **C:\\Windows\\System32**
- Copy all the files whose name starts with **msvcr** (e.g. **msvcr1230_clr0400.dll**) into the folder **C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin**

- In the MINGW64 terminal, type the following commands:

        **/mingw64/bin/python3 -m venv ~/ytdl-venv**

        **source ~/ytdl-venv/bin/activate**

- In a suitable text editor, open the file **C:\\msys64\\home\\YOURNAME\\.bashrc**
- At the top of the file, add the following lines, then save it

        **export PIP_HOME="$HOME/.local/pip"**

        **export PIP_BIN_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin"**

        **export PATH="$PIP_BIN_DIR:$PATH"**

- Nagivate to **C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\lib\\python3.12\\site-packages**
- Copy the following folders to **C:\\msys64\\home\\YOURNAME\\ytdl-venv\\lib\\python3.12\\site-packages**

        **certifi**

        **charset_normalizer**

        **gi**

        **idna**

        **requests**

        **urllib3**

- If you want to install `Atomic Parsley <https://github.com/wez/atomicparsley>`__, copy the MS Windows executable into the **C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin** folder

- In the MINGW64 terminal, type the following commands:

        **pip install feedparser**

        **pip install playsound**

        **pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-aria2**

- Download the **Tartube** source code from **Sourceforge**, using the links above
- Extract it into the folder **C:\\msys64\\home\\YOURNAME**, creating a folder called **C:\\msys64\\home\\YOURNAME\\tartube**
- You're now ready to start **Tartube**
- The simplest way to start **Tartube** is to double-click the **tartube_64bit.bat** file
- Otherwise, you can start **Tartube** from the MINGW64 terminal. If you have closed the terminal at any time since you started the manual installation, you first need to open it, and type this again:

        **source ~/ytdl-venv/bin/activate**

- Then type these commands in the MINGW64 terminal (don't forget to use *forward* slashes):

        **cd /home/YOURNAME/tartube**

        **python3 -X utf8 tartube/tartube**

- The **-X utf8** part enables **Tartube** to handle non-European alphabets (such as Japanese and Korean) correctly. If that is not a concern, then **Tartube** could be started like this:

        **python3 tartube/tartube**

5.2 Installation - MacOS
------------------------

Tartube can be installed on MacOS, but it's not a one-click operation.

Here are installation guides for new computers with Apple silicon, all other MacOS computers, and a troubleshooting section.

5.2.1 Installation - MacOS (Apple silicon)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With thanks to m3lab-zzl:

- Install `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`__ with homebrew

        **brew install cairo pkg-config python**

- Install `Gtk 3 <https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

        **pip3 install pycairo**

        **brew install gobject-introspection gtk+3**

- Install `Python Requests module <https://3.python-requests.org/>`__, and either `youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__ or `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__

        **pip3 install requests youtube-dl**

        **pip3 install requests yt-dlp**

- Install the Adwaita theme for icons used by Tartube (optional)

        **brew install adwaita-icon-theme**

- It is strongly recommended that you install `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__, too

        **brew install ffmpeg**

- Install Tartube

        **pip3 install tartube**

- Now run Tartube

        **tartube**

5.2.2 Installation - MacOS (other computers)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With thanks to JeremyShih:

- Install `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`__ by downloading an installer, or with homebrew

        **brew install pkg-config**

        **brew install python**

- Install `Gtk 3 <https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__

        **pip3 install pycairo**

        **brew install gobject-introspection**

        **python3 -m pip install PyGObject**

        **brew install gtk+3**

- Install `Python Requests module <https://3.python-requests.org/>`__

        **pip3 install requests**

- Install either `youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__ or `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__

        **pip3 install youtube-dl**

        **pip3 install yt-dlp**

- Install the Adwaita theme for icons used by Tartube (optional)

        **brew install adwaita-icon-theme**

- It is strongly recommended that you install `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__, too

        **brew install ffmpeg**

- Install Tartube

        **pip3 install tartube**

- Now run Tartube

        **tartube**

5.2.3 Troubleshooting on MacOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can't start **Tartube** from a terminal window (the final step in the procedures above), try these commands (with thanks to inkhalistan):

        **echo "export PATH="python3 -m site --user-base/bin:$PATH"" >> ~/.zprofile**

        **source ~/.zprofile**

        **tartube**

If you see a **gi module not found** error, there are two possible solutions.

- First, try typing this

        **pip3 install PyGObject**

If that does not work, try the following procedure.

- Get homebrew's location

        **which brew**

- For example if the command above returned ** /opt/homebrew/bin/brew**, then change directory by typing this

        **cd /opt/homebrew**

- Now find the **gi** package location

        **find . -name "gi"**

- Add that location to the PYTHONPATH variable, for example by adding this line to your **~/.zshrc** file

        **export PYTHONPATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.9/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH**

You may need to tell **Tartube**, where to find **FFmpeg**. Once you have finished the setup process, do this:

- Click **Edit > System preferences...**
- If the **Show advanced preferences** button is visible, click it
- Now click the **Downloaders > FFmpeg / AVConv** tab
- Next to **Path to the FFmpeg executable**, click the **Set** button
- Select the FFmpeg executable. Some MacOS users report that the correct path is **/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg**

5.3 Installation - Linux/BSD
----------------------------

Linux/BSD users can use any of the following installation methods.

5.3.1 Install using the DEB package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux distributions based on Debian, such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint, can install **Tartube** using the DEB package (see the links above).

**Tartube** requires either `youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__ or `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__. If it's already installed on your system, then you can start **Tartube** immediately. Otherwise, do this:

1. Run **Tartube**
2. **Tartube** asks you to choose a data directory, so do that
3. Click **Operations > Update youtube-dl**

It is strongly recommended that you install `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__, too. On most Debian-based systems, you can open a terminal window and run this command:

        **sudo apt-get install ffmpeg**

5.3.2 Install using the RPM package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linux distributions based on RHEL, such as Fedora, can install **Tartube** using the RPM package (see the links above).

**Tartube** requires either `youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__ or `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__. If it's already installed on your system, then you can start **Tartube** immediately.

Otherwise, if **pip** is already installed on your system, do this:

1. Run **Tartube**
2. **Tartube** asks you to choose a data directory, so do that
3. Click **Operations > Update youtube-dl**

If neither **youtube-dl** nor **pip** are installed on your system, then the recommended way to install **youtube-dl** is from the command line, using **pip**. (Software managers usually don't offer the most recent version of **youtube-dl**.)

On Fedora, the procedure is:

1. Open a terminal window
2. Type: ``sudo dnf -y install python3-pip``
3. Type: ``pip3 install youtube-dl`` or ``pip3 install yt-dlp``
4. You can now run **Tartube**.

It is strongly recommended that you install `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__, too. On most RHEL-based systems (for example, Fedora 29-32), you can open a terminal window and run these commands:

        **sudo dnf -y install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm**

        **sudo dnf -y install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm**

        **sudo apt-get install ffmpeg**

5.3.3 Install using the AUR package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Arch-based systems. such as Manjaro, Tartube can be installed using the semi-official AUR package. The procedure is:

1. Open a terminal window
2. Type: ``git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/tartube.git``
3. Type: ``cd tartube``
4. Type: ``makepkg -si``
5. You can now run **Tartube**.

It is strongly recommended that you install `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__, too. On most Arch-based systems, you can open a terminal window and run this command:

        **sudo pacman -S ffmpeg**

5.3.4 Install using the ebuild package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Gentoo-based systems, **Tartube** can be installed using the semi-official ebuild package, using the link above.

Tartube requires `youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__. It is strongly recommended that you install `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__, too.

If you're not sure how to install using ebuild, then it might be easier to install from PyPI.

5.3.5 Install using PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tartube** can be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/tartube/>`__ with or without root privileges.

Here is the procedure for Debian-based distributions, like Ubuntu and Linux Mint. The procedure on other distributions is probably very similar.

5.3.6 Install using PyPI (with root privileges)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Make sure **youtube-dl** has been completely removed from your system
2. Type: ``sudo apt install python3-pip``
3. ...but on Fedora, type: ``sudo dnf -y install python3-pip``
4. Type: ``sudo pip3 install youtube-dl tartube``, or type ``sudo pip3 install yt-dlp tartube``
5. Type: ``tartube``

5.3.7 Install using PyPI (without root privileges)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Type: ``sudo apt install python3-pip``
2. ...but on Fedora, type: ``sudo dnf -y install python3-pip``
3. Type: ``pip3 install tartube``
4. The **Tartube** executable is stored in ``~/.local/bin`` by default. If that is already in your path, you can start **Tartube** by typing ``tartube``. Otherwise, type ``~/.local/bin/tartube``
5. **Tartube** asks you to choose a data directory, so do that
6. In the **Tartube** main window, click **Edit > System preferences... > youtube-dl**
7. In the box marked **Path to youtube-dl executable**, select **Use PyPI path (\~/.local/bin/youtube-dl)**
8. Click **OK** to close the dialogue window
9. Click **Operations > Update youtube-dl**
10. Once the update has finished, **Tartube** is ready for use

5.3.8 Manual installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any other method of installation on Linux/BSD, the following dependencies are required:

- `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads>`__
- `Gtk 3 <https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
- `Python Requests module <https://3.python-requests.org/>`__
- Either `youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__ or `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__

These dependencies are optional, but recommended:

- `Python pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ - keeping youtube-dl up to date is much simpler when pip is installed
- `Python feedparser module <https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/>`__ - enables **Tartube** to detect livestreams
- `Python moviepy module <https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/>`__ - if the website doesn't tell **Tartube** about the length of its videos, moviepy can work it out
- `Python playsound module <https://pypi.org/project/playsound/>`__ - enables **Tartube** to play an alarm when a livestream starts
- `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__ - required for various video post-processing tasks; see the section below if you want to use FFmpeg
- `AtomicParsley <https://bitbucket.org/wez/atomicparsley/src/default/>`__ - required for embedding thumbnails in audio files
- `aria2 <https://aria2.github.io/>`__ - provides an external downloader for youtube-dl
- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ - required for drawing graphs
- `streamlink <https://streamlink.github.io/>`__ - can be used to download livestreams

5.3.9 Install from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing dependencies (see above):

1. Download and extract the source code (see the links above)
2. Change directory into the **Tartube** directory
3. Type: ``python3 setup.py install``
4. Type: ``tartube``

5.3.10 Run without installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After installing dependencies (see above):

1. Download and extract the source code (see the links above)
2. Change directory into the **Tartube** directory
3. Type: ``python3 tartube/tartube``

5.4 Packaging Tartube
---------------------

Tartube packages are usually created using one of the available environment variables:

- **TARTUBE_PKG** for packages without restrictions
- **TARTUBE_PKG_STRICT** for a package which should not download or update **youtube-dl** or **FFmpeg**; the user is required to install those packages separately
- **TARTUBE_PKG_NO_DOWNLOAD** for a package which should not download any videos (and also will not download/update **youtube-dl** or **FFmpeg**)

Some packaging systems might forbid installing other packages. If that's the case, you can use **TARTUBE_PKG_STRICT** or **TARTUBE_PKG_NO_DOWNLOAD**.

Anyone with concerns over the legality of downloading videos can disable that feature altogether. Tartube will still be able to check videos, channels and playlists, as well as monitor livestreams. Users can watch a video on its original website with a single click. The authors understand that the US courts have ruled that 'scraping' a website is legal. Popular sites like **YouTube** provide RSS feeds for this very purpose.

Packages can be created in the standard way. For example, an RPM package would be created with the command:

        **TARTUBE_PKG=1 python3 setup.py bdist_rpm**

5.4.1 Packaging Tartube on MS Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The procedure used to create the MS Windows installer is described in full in the
`installer script itself <nsis/tartube_install_64bit.nsi>`__.

6.1 Setting up Tartube
----------------------

When you first start **Tartube**, you will be asked to choose a few settings.

.. image:: screenshots/example1.png
  :alt: Tartube's setup window

Most users can use this window to download and install some packages. If not, those packages must be installed separately.

All of these settings can be changed later, if you want. For example, to change where **Tartube** stores its files, see `6.21 Managing databases`_.

6.2 Updating the downloader
---------------------------

*If you installed Tartube via a repository such as the official Debian repository, then Tartube may not be allowed to update youtube-dl. In that case, this section does not apply; update youtube-dl using your system's package manager.*

**Tartube** uses a downloader to interact with websites like **YouTube**. **Tartube** officially supports two downloaders,
`youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__ and `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__. (Other forks of **youtube-dl** will probably work as well.)

Websites changes their code frequently, and therefore the downloaders must be updated frequently.

- Click **Operations > Update youtube-dl**
- The name will be different if you're using a different downloader

.. image:: screenshots/example2.png
  :alt: Updating youtube-dl

6.3 Setting the downloader's location
--------------------------------------

If the update operation fails on MS Windows, you should `ask the authors for help <https://github.com/axcore/tartube/>`__.

On other systems, users can customise the downloader's location. There are several locations on your filesystem where **youtube-dl** might have been installed.

.. image:: screenshots/example3.png
  :alt: Updating youtube-dl

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Downloaders > File paths**
- Try changing the setting **Path to executable**
- Try changing the setting **Command for update operations**
- Try the update operation again

6.4 Installing FFmpeg / AVConv
------------------------------

`FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__ and `AVConv <https://sourceforge.io/projects/avconv/>`__ are commonly use for various video-processing tasks.

**It is strongly recommended that all users install FFmpeg**. Without it, Tartube won't be able to do any of these things:

- Display thumbnails from **YouTube**
- Download high-resolution videos from any website
- Download some video formats
- Convert video files to audio
- Split or slice videos

**youtube-dl** uses FFmpeg by default, but it can use AVConv for certain tasks.

For more information about **Tartube**'s use of FFmpeg and AVConv, see `6.26 More information about FFmpeg and AVConv`_.

6.4.1 On MS Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On MS Windows, the usual methods of FFmpeg installation will not work. You **must** download an MSYS2-compatible version of FFmpeg. This can be done in the setup window, or from **Tartube**'s main menu: click **Operations > Install FFmpeg...**.

There is no known method of installing a compatible version of AVConv.

6.4.2 On Linux/BSD/MacOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On all other operating systems, **Tartube** and **youtube-dl** should be able to find **FFmpeg** (and **AVConv**, if it is also installed) without any help from you.

If the **FFmpeg** / **AVConv** executables have been installed to an unusual location, you can tell **Tartube** where to find them.

.. image:: screenshots/example4.png
  :alt: Updating FFmpeg and AVConv

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Downloaders > FFmpeg / AVConv**
- Click the **Set** buttons and select the **FFmpeg** or **AVConv** executable
- Click the **Reset** buttons to remove that selection
- Click the the **Use default path** buttons to use the normal location for each executable

6.5 Introducing system folders
------------------------------

On the left side of the **Tartube** window is a list of folders. You can store videos, channels and playlists inside these folders. You can even store folders inside of other folders.

**Tartube** saves videos on your filesystem using exactly the same structure.

When you start **Tartube** for the first time, there are several folders already visible. You can't remove any of these folders (but you can hide them, if you want).

.. image:: screenshots/example5.png
  :alt: Tartube's system folders

- The **All Videos** folder shows every video in **Tartube**'s database, whether it has been downloaded or not
- The **Bookmarks** folder shows videos you've bookmarked, because they're interesting or important (see `6.17.1 Bookmarked videos`_ )
- The **Favourite Videos** folder shows videos in a channel, playlist or folder that you've marked as a favourite (see `6.17.2 Favourite channels, playlists and folders`_ )
- The **Livestreams** folder shows livestreams. Videos are automatically removed from this folder (but not from other folders) when the livestream is finished
- The **Missing videos** folder (see `6.25 Detecting missing videos`_ ) shows videos that you've downloaded, but which have since been removed from the website by their creator
- The **New Videos** folder shows videos that have been downloaded, but not yet watched
- The **Recent Videos** folder shows videos that were checked or downloaded, the last time you used **youtube-dl** (to change this behaviour, right-click the folder and select **Downloads > Set removal time...**)
- The **Waiting Videos** folder shows videos that you want to watch soon. When you watch the video, it's automatically removed from the folder (but not from **Tartube**'s database)
- Videos saved to the **Temporary Videos** folder will be deleted when **Tartube** next starts
- The **Unsorted Videos** folder is a useful place to put videos that don't belong to a particular channel or playlist
- The **Video Clips** folder is a useful place to put video clips  (see `6.27 Video clips`_)

6.6 Adding videos
-----------------

*If you want a simpler way to download videos, see* `6.23 Classic Mode`_.

You can add individual videos by clicking the **Add new videos** button near the top of the window. (On MS Windows, the text is not visible unless your mouse is hovering over the button, which is in the top-left corner.)

A dialogue window will appear.

.. image:: screenshots/example6.png
  :alt: Adding videos

Copy and paste the video's URL into the dialogue window. You can copy and paste as many URLs as you like.

When you're ready, click the **OK** button.

Finally, click on the **Unsorted Videos** folder to see the videos you've added.

.. image:: screenshots/example7.png
  :alt: Your first added video

6.7 Adding channels and playlists
---------------------------------

You can also add a whole channel by clicking the **Add a new channel** button or a whole playlist by clicking the **Add a new playlist** button.

**Tartube** will download all of the videos in the channel or playlist.

.. image:: screenshots/example8.png
  :alt: Adding a channel

Copy and paste the channel's URL into the dialogue window. You should also give the channel a name. The channel's name is usually the name used on the website (but you can choose almost any name you like).

6.8 Adding videos, channels and playlists together
--------------------------------------------------

When adding a long list of URLs, containing a mixture of channels, playlists and individual videos, it's quicker to add them all at the same time. Click the **Add new videos** button near the top of the window, and paste all the links into the dialogue window.

**Tartube** doesn't know anything about these links until you actually download them (or check them). If it's expecting an individual video, but receives a channel or a playlist, **Tartube** will the handle the conversion for you.

By default, **Tartube** converts a link into a channel, when necessary. You can change this behaviour, if you want to.

- In **Tartube**'s main window, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Preferences**
- Select one of the buttons under **URL flexibility preferences**

Unfortunately, there is no way for **Tartube** to distinguish a channel from a playlist. Most video websites don't supply that information.

If your list of URLs contains a mixture of channels and playlists, you can convert one to the other after the download has finished.

- In **Tartube**'s main window, right-click a channel, and select **Channel actions > Convert to playlist**
- Alternatively, right-click a playlist, and select **Playlist actions > Convert to channel**
- After converting, you can set a name for the new channel/playlist by right-clicking it, and selecting **Channel actions > Rename channel...** or **Playlist actions > Rename playlist...**

6.8.1 Bulk-adding channels and playlists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're confident that your long list of URLs contains only channels and playlists, there are a couple of other ways to add them.

Firstly, you can click **Media > Add many channels/playlists...**.

Secondly, you could import a text file contaiing a list of channels/playlists. You can write the text file yourself. Each channel/playlist is defined by three consecutive lines, in the following format:

        @channel

        Alice's Channel

        <url>

        @playlist

        Bob's Playlist

        <url>

... where **<url>** is the web address of the channel/playlist. (Leave out the diamond brackets.)

When you're ready, click **Media > Export/import > Import into database...**

6.8.2 Replacing generic channel/playlist names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several situations in which **Tartube** might create a channel with a generic name like **channel_1**, or a playlist with a generic name like **playlist_2**.

* Click the **Add video video(s)** button, and enter a URL which is actually a channel or a playlist
* Add several channels/playlists together by clicking **Media > Add many channels/playlists...**

In this situation, you can either rename all the new channels and playlists yourself, one at a time, or you can let **Tartube** try to do it automatically. (This works fine on **YouTube** and many other sites, but not necessarily on all of them.)

* For each channel/playlist you want to rename, download or check at least one video
* Tartube will extract the channel/playlist name from each video's metadata
* In the main menu, click **Media > Reset channel/playlist names...**
* Select everything you want to rename
* When you're ready, click the **OK** button to perform the renaming

6.8.3 Replacing channel/playlist URLs in bulk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to update the URLs of many channels and playlists, you can do so by clicking **Edit > System preferences... > Files > URLs**.

6.9 Adding folders
------------------

The left-hand side of the window will quickly still filling up. It's a good idea to create some folders, and to organise your channels/playlists inside those folders.

Click the **Add a new folder** button near the top of the window,  and create a folder called **Comedy**.

.. image:: screenshots/example9.png
  :alt: Adding a folder

Then repeat that process to create a folder called **History**. You can then drag-and-drop your channels and playlists into those folders.

.. image:: screenshots/example10.png
  :alt: A channel inside a folder

6.10 Things you can do
----------------------

Once you've finished adding videos, channels, playlists and folders, you can make **Tartube** do something. **Tartube** offers the following operations:

.. image:: screenshots/example11.png
  :alt: The Check and Download buttons

Checking/download videos:

- **Check** - Fetches information about videos, but doesn't download them
- **Download** - Actually downloads the videos. If you have disabled downloads for a particular item, **Tartube** will just fetch information about it instead
- **Custom download** - Downloads videos in a non-standard way; see `6.14 Custom downloads`_
- To **Check** or **Download** videos, channels and playlists, use the main menu, or the buttons near the top of the window, or the buttons in the bottom-left corner, or right-click an individual video, channel, playlist or folder
- A **Custom Download** can be started from the main menu (**Operations > Custom download all**) or by right-clicking a video, channel, playlist or folder

Refreshing the database:

- **Refresh** - Examines your filesystem. If you have manually copied any videos to the location in which **Tartube** stores its files, those videos are added to **Tartube**'s database
- To **Refresh** **Tartube**'s database, use the main menu (**Operations > Refresh database...**) or right-click a channel/playlist/folder
- *Protip*: Do a **'Check'** operation before you do **'Refresh'** operation

Updating packages:

- **Update** - Installs or updates **youtube-dl**, as described in `6.2 Updating the downloader`_. On MS Windows, also installs **FFmpeg** (see `6.4 Installing FFmpeg / AVConv`_), **matplotlib** (see `7.31 Graphs not visible`_) and `streamlink <https://streamlink.github.io/>`__ (see `6.24 Livestreams`_)
- *Protip*: Do an **'Update'** operation before you do a **'Check'** or **'Download'** operation

Fetching information:

- **Info** - Fetches information about a particular video: either the available video/audio formats, or the available subtitles
- To fetch **Info** about a video, right-click it and select **Fetch**

Tidying up the filesytem:

- **Tidy** - Tidies up **Tartube**'s data directory (folder), as well as checking that downloaded videos still exist and are not corrupted
- To **Tidy** the data directory, use the main menu (**Operations > Tidy up files...**) or right-click a channel/playlist/folder

Dealing with livestreams:

- **Livestream check** - Checks whether any livestreams have started (or stopped), without fetching the full list of videos from a channel/playlist
- **Livestream download** - Downloads a livestream that's broadcasting now; see `6.24.4 Downloading livestreams`_
- A **Livestream check** happens every few minutes (if **Tartube** detected livestreams during a **Check** or a **Download**). To force a check now, click **Livestreams > Update existing livestreams**

Processing videos with **FFmpeg**:

- **Process** - Processes videos and thumbnails with **FFmpeg** - see `6.26 More information about FFmpeg and AVConv`_
- To process video(s) and/or their thumbnails, right-click a video and select **Special > Process with FFmpeg...**

6.11 Profiles
-------------

Next to each channel, playlist and folder is a checkbox. Click one or more of the checkboxes, and the buttoms in the bottom-left corner of the **Videos** tab will change:

.. image:: screenshots/example33.png
  :alt: Marked channels, playlists and folders

This is one way of checking or downloading just some of the channels, playlists and folders. Other methods include:

- Right-click a channel, and select **Download channel** (and so on)
- Move channels and playlists into a single folder, then right-click that folder and select **Download folder**

If you frequently mark a group of channels, playlists and folders for download, then you can create a profile. A profile is just a list of items that have been marked for download.

- Click **Media > Profiles > Create profile**
- In the dialogue window, choose a profile name, then click **OK** to create the profile
- Later, click **Media > Profiles > Switch profile** to mark the same items for download

If you select **Media > Profiles > Remember last profile**, then **Tartube** will automatically switch to that profile, whenever the database is loaded.

Note that the red system folders can't be marked for download.

6.12 Download options
---------------------

**youtube-dl** offers a large number of download options. This is how to set them.

.. image:: screenshots/example12.png
  :alt: Opening the download options window

- Click **Edit > General download options...**

A new window opens. Any changes you make in this window aren't actually applied until you click the **'Apply'** or **'OK'** buttons.

6.12.1 Advanced download options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the options are intended for advanced users, so they're hidden by default. To reveal them, click the button **Show advanced download options**.

.. image:: screenshots/example13.png
  :alt: Showing advanced download options

After clicking the button, some new tabs will appear. The existing tabs will also have some new features.

6.12.2 Other download options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you click **Edit > General download options...**, you are seeing the *default* download options. If you want to apply a *different* set of download options to a particular channel or particular playlist, you can do so.

At the moment, the general download options apply to *all* the videos, channels, playlists and folders you've added.

.. image:: screenshots/example14.png
  :alt: The window with only general download options applied

Now, suppose you want to apply some download options to the **History** folder:

-  Right-click the folder, and select **Downloads > Apply download options...**

In the new window, select **Create new download options**, and then click the **OK** button. A second window will appear, so you can click the **OK** button there, too.

The new options are applied to *everything* in the **History folder**. A pen icon appears above the folder to remind you of this.

.. image:: screenshots/example15.png
  :alt: Download options applied to the History folder

Now, suppose you want to add a *different* set of download options, but only for the channel **OverSimplified**.

-  Right-click the channel, and select **Downloads > Apply download options...**
-  In the new windows, click the **OK** button

The previous set of download options still applies to everything in the **History** folder, *except* the channel **OverSimplified**.

.. image:: screenshots/example16.png
  :alt: Download options applied to The Armchair Historian channel

6.12.3 Managing download options
--------------------------------

In fact, you can create as many sets of download options as you like.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Options > Download options**

.. image:: screenshots/example17.png
  :alt: The list of download options

The first item in the list, **general**, is the default set of download options. The second item, **classic**, is the set of download options that apply in the **Classic Mode** tab (see `6.23 Classic Mode`_).

Download options are saved in the Tartube database, so if you switch databases (see `6.21.2 Multiple databases`_), a different selection of download options will apply. If you want to move a set of download options from one database to another, you can **Export** them, then switch databases, then **Import** them.

6.12.4 Setting download options
-------------------------------

Here is a quick summary of the download options that are most useful, assuming that advanced download options are hidden (see `6.12.1 Advanced download options`_).

You can change the format of the filename for the downloaded video, so it includes useful information such as the playlist number or the video resolution.

- Click **Files > File names**
- In the drop-down box marked **Format for video file names**, select one of the options
- If you select the **Custom** option, the drop-down boxes and buttons below become useable

When you download a video, a thumbnail and a metadata file are usually downloaded too. This can be customised.

- Click **Files > Write/move** to select which files are downloaded
- Click **Files > Keep** to select which files are not deleted at the end of the download operation

If you want to specify which video and audio formats should be downloaded, at which resolution and at which bitrate, do this:

- Click the **Formats** tab
- From the list on the left, select one of the video/audio formats
- Click the **Add format** button

**youtube-dl** downloads very high-resolution videos as two separate files, video and audio. If **Ffmpeg** is installed, the two separate files are automatically merged into one output file.

If you want to specify the format of the output file, for example to create an **.mp4** file, do this:

- Click **Files > Formats**
- From the list on the left, select **mp4**
- Click the **Add format** button
- In the drop-down box marked **If a merge is required after post-processing, output to this format**, select **mp4**

Most videos cannot be downloaded in every media format. For example, **YouTube** does not offer **mp3** downloads. If you want files in a particular video/audio format, often it's necessary to use **Ffmpeg** to convert the downloaded video.

- Click **Files > Convert**
- Select a video and/or audio format

**youtube-dl** can download subtitles for a video, if they exist. The chat replay of **YouTube** livestreams can also be downloaded, and is handled as if it were another set of subtitles.

- Click **Subtitles > Options**
- Select **Download all available subtitle files**

If you want to download subtiles only in particular languages:

- Select **Download subtitles file for these languages**
- Select a language from the list on the left
- Click the **Add language** button
- Repeat for as many languages as you want

See also `6.14.7 Ignoring videos without subtitles`_.

6.12.5 Customising download options
-----------------------------------

If you want to set the download options manually - typing them, rather than clicking some buttons - you can do so.

- Click **Edit > General download options...**
- In the **Additional download options** box, type any download options
- For example, to download a video as an .mp3 file, you could type **-x --audio-format mp3**

.. image:: screenshots/example36.png
  :alt: Customising download options

Download options added here **override everything else in the window**. (However, they don't override the format selector in the **Classic Mode** tab.)

You can find a complete list of download options for youtude-dl `here <https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl>`__, and a complete list for yt-dlp `here <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>`__.

6.13 Scheduled downloads
------------------------

**Tartube** can check and download videos, channels and playlists on a regular schedule. This is very useful if you want to leave **Tartube** running unattended.

.. image:: screenshots/example18.png
  :alt: The Scheduling tab

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Scheduling > Start**
- In the box, type a name for the scheduled download, for example **test**
- Click the **Add** button to create the scheduled download

.. image:: screenshots/example19.png
  :alt: The scheduled download tab

A new window appears. You can use this window to congifure the scheduled download.

- In the **Download mode** box, select whether **Tartube** should check videos, download them, or perform a custom download (see `6.14 Custom downloads`_)
- In the **Start** tab, select whether this download should be performed once, or when **Tartube** starts, or at regular intervals, or at specified times

When you specify a start time like 'Mondays at 15:00', there is a five-minute window in which the scheduled download can begin. This means that, if you open Tartube at 15:02, the scheduled download will still start (but not if you open Tartube at 15:10).

Now click the **Media** tab. By default, a scheduled download checks or downloads everything in **Tartube**'s database, but if you don't want that, you can select individual channels, playlists and folders.

There are several ways to add channels, playlists and folders to this list:

- In the dropdown box, select the channel/playlist/folder, and click **Add**
- In the main window's **Videos** tab, right-click the channel/playlist/folder and select **Downloads > Add to scheduled download...**
- Drag and drop the channel/playlist/folder from the main window into this window

You can create as many scheduled downloads as you like. Scheduled downloads are performed in order, from the top of the list to the bottom.

6.14 Custom downloads
---------------------

By default, **Tartube** downloads videos as quickly as possible, one URL (link) at a time. A URL might point to an individual video, or it might point to a whole channel or playlist. **Tartube** will try to download every video associated with the URL.

A **Custom download** enables you to modify this behaviour, if desired. You can use it to fetch videos from a mirror, add random delays, download video clips, download (or ignore) only livestreams, ignore videos without subtitles, or to download videos with the adverts removed.

It's important to note that a custom download behaves exactly like a regular download until you specify the new behaviour.

6.14.1 Default custom downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, **Tartube** provides two custom downloads.

The custom download called **general** applies in the **Videos** tab. It is used, for example, when you right-click a channel and select **Custom download channel**.

If you use the **general** custom download a lot, you can add an extra button to the **Videos** tab.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Windows > Videos**
- Select the button **Show a 'Custom download all' button in the Videos tab**

.. image:: screenshots/example20.png
  :alt: The option custom download button

The custom download called **classic** applies in the **Classic Mode** tab. To enable it, right-click the menu button in the top-right corner of the tab, and select **Enable custom downloads**.

6.14.2 Adding custom downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the those, you can create as many new custom downloads as you want.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Custom**
- In the **Name** box, type any name
- Click the **Add** button
- A new window opens, in which you can specify the new behaviour

Now, when you select a custom download in the **Videos** tab (for example, by right-clicking a channel and selecting **Custom download channel**, you'll be prompted to choose the custom download you want.

6.14.3 Independent downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, **Tartube** instructs **youtube-dl** to download a channel or a playlist. **youtube-dl** only needs a link to the channel or playlist, so **Tartube** doesn't send it a link to every single video.

If you need to download each individual video, one URL at a time, you can do this:

- Open the window for your preferred custom download. For example, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Custom**, click **general** to select it, and click the **Edit** button
- In the new window, click **Download each video independently of its channel or playlist** to select it
- If it is not already selected, click **Check channels/playlists/folders before each custom download**
- Click **OK** to close the window

Many custom download settings only work when Tartube is downloading videos one at a time. If you enable this setting, you will be able to enable several other settings in the other tabs.

6.14.4 Diverting to HookTube / Invidious
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If **Tartube** can't download a video from YouTube, it's sometimes possible to obtain it from an alternative website instead.

- Open the window for your preferred custom download. For example, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Custom**, click **general** to select it, and click the **Edit** button
- In the new window, click the **Mirrors** tab
- Click **Obtain the video from HookTube rather than YouTube** to select it
- Click **OK** to close the window
- You can now start the custom download

There are a number of alternative YouTube front-ends available, besides `HookTube <https://hooktube.com/>`__. The original `Invidious <https://invidio.us/>`__ closed in September 2020, but there are a number of mirrors, such as `this one <https://yewtu.be/>`__. To get a list of mirrors, `see this page <https://instances.invidio.us/>`__, or use your favourite search engine.

When specifying an alternative website, it's very important that you type the *exact text* that replaces **youtube.com** in a video's URL. For example, you must type **hooktube.com**, not **www.hooktube.com** or **http://www.hooktube.com/**.

6.14.5 Delays between downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the video website is complaining that you're making too many requests (in other words, downloading too many videos too quickly), it's possible to add a delay betwen downloads. The delay can have a fixed or random duration.

- Open the window for your preferred custom download. For example, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Custom**, click **general** to select it, and click the **Edit** button
- In the new window, click the **Delays** tab
- Click **Apply a delay after each video/channel/playlist is downloaded** to select it
- Set the maximum delay (in minutes)
- If you also set a minimum delay. If you do, **Tartube** uses a random value between the maximum and minimum
- Click **OK** to close the window
- You can now start the custom download

The delay is applied after downloading a channel or a playlist. If you want to apply the delay after each video, you should enable individual video downloads as well (as described above).

6.14.6 Splitting and slicing videos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During a custom download, you can automatically split a video into video clips *while it is being downloaded*. A list of clips can be grabbed from the video's description, or from its chapter list, or you can specify your own list of clips. For more information, see see `6.27 Video clips`_

You can also remove slices from a video *while it is being downloaded*. This is useful for removing adverts, intros and outros. A list of video slices is obtained from a `SponsorBlock server <https://sponsor.ajay.app/>`__. Alternatively, you can specify your own list of video slices. For more information, see see `6.28 Video slices`_

Both of these features require **FFmpeg**.

6.14.7 Ignoring videos without subtitles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can ask Tartube not to download videos without subtitles.

- Open the window for your preferred custom download. For example, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Custom**, click **general** to select it, and click the **Edit** button
- In the new window, click the **Subtitles** tab
- Click **Only download videos with available subtitles** to select it
- Click **OK** to close the window
- You can now start the custom download

Note that this setting *reduces the number of videos downloaded*. It isn't responsible for downloading the subtitles themselves. Here is how to do that:

- In Tartube's main menu, click **Edit > General download options > Subtitles > Options**
- Select **Download all available subtitle files**
- Alternatively, select **Download subtitle files for these languages**, and then add one or more languages below
- Click **OK** to close the window
- You can now start the custom download

**youtube-dl** handles YouTube live chat in the same way as subtitles, so you can select that instead of (or as well as) the languages.

6.14.8 Launching custom downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Besides the optional button described above, there are several ways to start a custom download.

- Right-click a video, and select **Custom download video**
- Right-click a channel, playlist or folder, and select **Custom download channel**, and so on
- In the **Classic Mode** tab, click the menu icon in the top-right corner, and select **Enable custom downloads**. When you're ready to begin, click the **Custom download all** button in the bottom-right corner
- From the main menu, click **Operations > Custom download all**

6.15 Watching videos
--------------------

If you've downloaded a video, you can watch it by clicking the word **Player**.

.. image:: screenshots/example21.png
  :alt: Watching a video

If you haven't downloaded the video yet, you can watch it online by clicking the word **YouTube**, **Twitch**, **Website**, **Odysee**, **BitChute** or **Website**. (One or the other will be visible).

Restricted YouTube videos (not available in your region, or not visible without a Google account) can sometimes be watched without restrictions on an alternative website, such as `HookTube <https://hooktube.com/>`__ or an Invidious mirror `such as this one <https://invidious.site/>`__.

As mentioned above, the original Invidious server has now closed. You can change the Invidious mirror that **Tartube** is using, if you like.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Mirrors**
- Enter a new Invidious mirror in the box
- Click **OK** to close the window
- You can now watch a video by clicking its **Invidious** label

6.16 Filtering and finding videos
---------------------------------

Beneath the videos you'll find a toolbar. The buttons are self-explanatory, except for the one on the right.

.. image:: screenshots/example22.png
  :alt: The video catalogue toolbar

Click that button, and a larger toolbar is revealed. You can use this to filter out videos, change the order in which videos are displayed, or find a video uploaded at a certain date.

.. image:: screenshots/example23.png
  :alt: The toolbar's hidden buttons revealed

- Use the **Sort** box to change how videos are sorted. The button next to it can be used at any time force a re-sort
- Use the **Thumbnail size** box to change the size of the video grid (it doesn't affect other layouts)
- Toggle the **Frame** and **Icons** buttons to tweak the layout

You can search for videos by applying a filter. For example, you could search for videos whose name contains the word **History**:

- In the **Filter** box, type **History**
- The search is case-insensitive, so it doesn't matter if you type **History** or **history**
- Click the magnifiying glass button. All matching videos are displayed
- Click the cancel button next it to remove the filter

You can also search using a *regular expression* (regex), too. These searches are also case-insensitive. For example, to find all videos whose name begins with the word "Minecraft":

- In the **Filter** box, type **\^Minecraft**
- Click the **Regex** button to select it
- Click the magnifying glass button. All matching videos are displayed
- To search using ordinary text, rather than a regex, de-select the **Regex** button

By default, the search applies to video names. You can toggle to buttons so it applies to descriptions and/or comments, as well.

Alternatively, you can find videos uploaded around a certain date.

- Click the **Find date** button to select a date
- If there are several pages of videos, **Tartube** will show the page containing the videos uploaded closest to this date

6.17 Marking videos
-------------------

You can mark videos, channels, playlists and folders that you find interesting, or which are important.

- You can **bookmark** a video
- You can **favourite** a channel, playlist or folder

Bookmarked and favourite videos shouldn't be confused with archived videos, which are protected from automatic deletion - see `6.19 Archiving videos`_.

6.17.1 Bookmarked videos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to bookmark a video.

- Right-click a video, and click **Mark Video > Video is bookmarked** to select it
- If the **B/mark** label is visible under the video's name, click it. (If not, click the **Switch** button to select a different layout)
- Right-click a channel, and select **Channel contents > Mark as bookmarked**. This will bookmark every video in the channel, but it won't automatically bookmark videos that are added to the channel later
- (This can also be done with playlists and folders)

A bookmarked video appears in **Tartube**'s own **Bookmarks** folder, as well as in its usual location.

6.17.2 Favourite channels, playlists and folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you mark a channel, playlist or folder as a favourite, all of its videos will also be visible in **Tartube**'s own **Favourite Videos** folder.

If new videos are later added to the channel, playlist or folder, they will automatically appear in the **Favourite Videos** folder.

(It's possible to mark or unmark an individual video as a favourite, but it's better to use bookmarking for that.)

- Right-click a channel, and select **Channel contents > Mark as favourite**
- Right-click a playlist, and select **Playlist contents > Mark as favourite**
- Right-click a folder, and select **Folder contents > All contents > Mark as favourite**
- If you just want to mark the videos in a folder as favourites, but not any channels or playlists it contains, select **Folder contents > Just folder videos > Mark as favourite**

6.18 Combining channels, playlists and folders
----------------------------------------------

**Tartube** can download videos from several channels and/or playlists into a single directory (folder) on your computer's filesystem. There are four situations in which this might be useful:

- A channel has several playlists. You have added both the channel and its playlists to **Tartube**'s database, but you don't want to download duplicate videos
- A creator releases their videos on **Odysee** as well as on **YouTube**. You have added both channels, but you don't want to download duplicate videos
- You don't care about keeping videos in separate directories/folders on your filesystem. You just want to download all videos to one location
- A separate application will process the videos, after Tartube has downloaded them

6.18.1 Combining one channel and many playlists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A creator might have a single channel, and several playlists. The playlists contain videos from that channel (but not necessarily *every* video).

You can add the channel and its playlists in the normal way but, if you do, **Tartube** will download many videos twice.

The solution is to tell **Tartube** to store all the videos from the channel and its playlists in a single location. In that way, you can still see a list of videos in each playlist, but duplicate videos are not actually downloaded.

- Click **Media > Add channel**..., and then enter the channel's details
- Click **Media > Add playlist**... for each playlist
- Now, right-click on each playlist in turn, and then select **Downloads > Set download destination...**
- In the dialogue window, click **Use a different location**, select the name of the channel, then click the **OK** button.

A quicker way to add multiple playlists is from Tartube's main menu. Click **Media > Add many channels/playlists...**.

6.18.2 Extracting playlists from a channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described above, a creator might have a single channel, and several playlists. If there are a *lot* of playlists, it might take a long time to add them all to Tartube's database. However, there is a shortcut for YouTube channels.

- On the channel's webpage, click the **Playlists** tab
- Add a new channel to Tartube's database, using this URL (which should end in **../playlists**)

**YouTube** does not always send us the list of playlists; that's why it's necessary to click the **Playlists** tab, rather than the **Videos** tab, as we normally would.

Now you have two choices. If you want to keep the original channel in your database, without downloading duplicate videos, do this:

- In Tartube's main window, right-click the channel, and select **Check channel**
- When the operation has finished, right-click the channel and select **Show > Channel properties... > Associated Playlists**
- Select the button **Set the channel as the download destination**
- Click the **Add all playlists** button
- Click **OK** to close the window
- On the channel's webpage, click the **Videos** tab
- In Tartube's main window, right-click the channel, and select **Channel actions > Set URL...**, and replace the URL with the one ending in **../videos**

Alternatively, if you don't want to keep the original channel, do this:

- In Tartube's main window, right-click the channel, and select **Check channel**
- When the operation has finished, right-click the channel and select **Show > Channel properties... > Associated Playlists**
- Click the **Add all playlists button**
- Click **OK** to close the window
- When you're ready, delete the channel

6.18.3 Combining channels from different websites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A creator might release their videos on **YouTube**, but also on a site like **Odysee**. Sometimes they will only release a particular video on **Odysee**.

You can add both channels in the normal way but, if you do, **Tartube** will download many videos twice.

The solution is to tell **Tartube** to store videos from both channels in a single location. In that way, you can still see a list of videos in each channel, but duplicate videos are not actually downloaded.

- Click **Media > Add channel**..., and then enter the **YouTube** channel's details
- Click **Media > Add channel**..., and then enter the **Odysee** channel's details
- Right-click the **Odysee** channel and select **Downloads > Set download destination...**
- In the dialogue window, click **Use a different location**, select the name of the **YouTube** channel, then click the **OK** button

It doesn't matter which of the two channels you use as the download destination. There is also no limit to the number of parallel channels, so if a creator uploads videos to a dozen different websites, you can add them all.

6.18.4 Download all videos to a single folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't care about keeping videos in separate directories/folders on your filesystem, you can download *all* videos into the **Unsorted videos** folder. Regardless of whether you have added one channel or a thousand, all the videos will be stored in that one location.

- Click **Edit > General download options... > Files > Filesystem**
- Click the **Download all videos into this folder** button to select it
- In the combo next to it, select **Unsorted Videos**

Alternatively, you could select **Temporary Videos**. If you do, videos will be deleted when you restart **Tartube**.

6.18.5 Download all videos to an external folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all files are downloaded into Tartube's data folder. Users often request that **Tartube** should be able to download videos to other locations in the filesystem, *while retaining those videos in Tartube's database.*

A whole bunch of things can go wrong when we start writing files to arbitrary locations on hard drives that may or may not be accessible in the future. Tartube is simply not designed to handle file input/output of that complexity.

In addition, writing files outside Tartube's data folder breaks portability because it's no longer possible for the folder to be copied or moved anywhere else.

Nevertheless, since v2.4.0 it has been possible to download videos to any location in the filesystem for which you have read/write permissions. (It has always been possible to do so from the **Classic Mode** tab). *Don't do it without a good reason*. Good reasons include:

- A separate application will process the videos, after Tartube has downloaded them
- You want some videos (but not others) to be available on a drive shared between several devices
- You are an advanced user and you're happy to deal with any filesystem problems yourself

If one of these reasons applies, then you can do this:

- Right-click a channel, playlist or folder, and select **Downloads > Set download destination...** (etc)
- Select **Use an external location**
- Click the **Set** button, and choose an external folder
- When you're ready, click the **OK** button to apply your changes

6.18.6 External folders and yt-dlp
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users of `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/>`__ should be aware of the download option **--paths**, which may be more convenient in some situations. See the **yt-dlp** documentation for more information about how it works. In Tartube, it can be configured like this:

- Click **Edit > General download options...**
- If the **Show advanced download options** button is visible, click it
- The option **--output** can be set in the **Files > Override** tab
- The option **--paths** can be set in the **Files > Paths** tab

6.19 Archiving videos
---------------------

You can tell **Tartube** to automatically delete videos after some period of time. This is useful if hard drive is smaller than the size of the observable universe.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Files > Delete**
- Click the **Automatically delete downloaded videos** button to select it
- If you want to, change the number of days from **30** to some other value

Alternatively, you can select **Remove downloaded videos from the database (but don't delete files)**.

If you want to protect your favourite videos from being deleted or removed automatically, you can *archive* them. Only videos that have actually been downloaded can be archived.

- Right-click a video, and select **Video is archived**

You can also archive all the videos in a channel, playlist or folder.

- For example, right-click a folder and select **Channel contents > Mark videos as archived**
- This action applies to *all* videos that are *currently* in the folder, including the contents of any channels and playlists in that folder
- It doesn't apply to any videos you might download in the future

6.20 Performance limits
-----------------------

By default, **Tartube** downloads two video, channels or playlists at a time, as quickly as possible (in other words, without bandwidth limits).

You can change this behaviour in the **Progress** tab, if you want.

- At the bottom of the tab, select the **Max downloads** button, and change the maximum number of simultaneous downloads
- Alternatively, select the **D/L speed** button, and set the maximum bandwidth you're willing to allocate to **Tartube**

These are the default settings. Many users might want lower download speeds during the day, but higher download speeds at night (and so on).

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Limits**
- The settings in the top half of the tab are the ones visible in the **Progress** tab
- The settings in the bottom half of the tab apply only during certain times of the day, and on certain days

There is a third way to change **Tartube**'s behaviour. The maximum downloads and bandwidth limits can also be set for a scheduled download (see `6.13 Scheduled downloads`_).

**Tartube** honours most requests to change the maximum downloads and the bandwidth limit, so it's not a good idea to set lots of different values.

6.21 Managing databases
-----------------------

**Tartube** downloads all of its videos into a single directory (folder) - the **Tartube data directory**. The contents of this directory comprise the **Tartube database**.

**Tartube** stores important files here, some of which are invisible (by default). Don't let other applications store their files here, too.

*You can modify the contents of the directory yourself, if you want, but don't do that while Tartube is running.*

It's fine to add new videos to the database, or to remove them. Just be careful that you don't delete any sub-directories (folders), including those which are hidden, and don't modify the **Tartube** database file, **tartube.db**.

6.21.1 Importing videos from other applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tartube** is a GUI front-end for **youtube-dl**, but it is not the only one. If you've downloaded videos using another application, this is how to add them to **Tartube**'s database.

- In **Tartube**'s main window, add each channel and playlist in the normal way
- When you're ready, click the **Check all** button. This adds a list of videos to **Tartube**'s database, without actually downloading the videos themselves
- Now copy the video files into **Tartube**'s data directory (folder). For example, copy all your **Games Channel** videos into **../tartube-data/Games Channel**
- In the **Tartube** menu, click **Operations > Refresh database...**
- **Tartube** will search for video files, and try to match them with the list of videos you just compiled
- The whole process might some time, so be patient

6.21.2 Multiple databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tartube** can only use one database at a time, but you can create as many databases as you want.

For example, you could create a new database on an external hard drive.

- In the main window's menu, click **File > Database preferences...**
- In the new window, click the **Add new database** button
- Another new window appears. Use it to create a directory (folder) on your external hard drive

**Tartube** remembers the location of the databases it has loaded. To switch back to your original database:

- In the main menu, click **File > Database preferences...**
- In the list, click the original database to select it
- Click the **Switch to this database** button

6.21.3 Multiple Tartubes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tartube** can't load more than one database, but you can run as many instances of **Tartube** as you want.

If you have added three databases to the list, and if you have three **Tartube** windows open at the same time, then by default each window will be using a different database.

By default, the databases are loaded in the order they appear in the list.

6.21.4 Exporting/importing the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can export the contents of **Tartube**'s database and, at any time in the future, import that information into a different **Tartube** database, perhaps on a different computer.

It is important to note that *only a list of videos, channels, playlists and folders are exported*. The videos themselves are not exported, and neither are any thumbnail, description or metadata files.

- Click **Media > Export/import > Export from database...**
- In the dialogue window, choose what you want to export
- If you want a list that you can edit in an ordinary text editor, select the **Export as plain text** option
- If you want a list that you can edit in a spreadsheet, select the **Export as CSV** option
- Otherwise, you should select the **Export as JSON** option
- Click the **OK** button, then select where to save the export file

It is safe to share this export file with other people. It doesn't contain any personal information.

This is how to import the data into a different **Tartube** database.

- Click **Media > Export/import > Import into database...**
- Select the export file you created earlier
- A dialogue window will appear. You can choose how much of the database you want to import

6.21.5 Importing from YouTube
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also import your **YouTube** subscriptions directly.

- Click **Media > Export/import > Import YouTube subscriptions**
- A wizard window opens, showing you how to export your YouTube subscriptions as a single **.zip** file
- When you have the export file, click the **Next** button
- Click **Select file**, and choose the export file
- If the file is valid, click the **Next** button again
- Select the channels you want to import, then click **OK** to update Tartube's database

If you have a lot of channels to import, you might want to import them into a folder.

- In the **Videos** tab, create a new folder, or select an existing folder
- Click **Media > Import YouTube subscriptions**, and continue as above

6.21.6 Old Export formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The format of exported plain text/CSV files changed in v2.3.208, and again in v2.3.307. If you try to import files from earlier versions, you may not get everything you were expecting.

Here are some notes for anyone who wants to edit the CSV export by hand (for example, in a spreadsheet):

- There are six columns
- A parent channel/playlist/folder is always listed directly above its child videos/channels/playlists/folders
- The first column should contain the string **video**, **channel**, **playlist** or **folder**
- The second column is the name of the video/channel/playlist/folder. Note that channels/playlists/folders cannot share a name (but any number of duplicate video names are allowed)
- The third column is the URL for a video, channel or playlist. This field is always empty for folders
- The fourth column is the name of the parent channel, playlist or folder (or an empty field, if there is no parent)
- The fifth and sixth columns apply only to videos. For channels/playlists/folders, they are always empty fields. For videos, they can still be empty fields, if the data is not known
- The fifth column is the video ID supplied by the website
- The sixth column is the video filename (e.g. **my video.mp4**)

Here are some notes for anyone who wants to edit the plain text export by hand:

- Channels/playlists/folders are represnted by groups of four lines
- Videos are represented by groups of six lines
- Each group starts with the line **@video**, **@channel**, **@playlist** or **@folder**
- A parent channel/playlist/folder is always listed directly above its child videos/channels/playlists/folders
- Line 2 is the name of the video/channel/playlist/folder. Note that channels/playlists/folders cannot share a name (but any number of duplicate video names are allowed)
- Line 3 is the URL for a video, channel or playlist. This line is always empty for folders
- Line 4 is the name of the parent channel, playlist or folder (or an empty line, if there is no parent)
- For videos, line 5 is the video ID supplied by the website (or an empty line, if the ID is unknown)
- For videos, line 6 is the video filename (e.g. **my video.mp4**, or an empty line, if the filename is unknown)

6.22 Converting to audio
------------------------

**Tartube** can automatically extract the audio from its downloaded videos, if that's what you want.

The first step is to make sure that either FFmpeg or AVconv is installed on your system - see `6.4 Installing FFmpeg / AVConv`_.

The remaining steps are simple:

- In **Tartube**'s main window, click **Edit > General download options...**
- In the new window, click the **Convert** tab
- Select the checkbox **Download each video, extract the sound, and then discard the original video**
- In the boxes below, select an audio format and an audio quality
- Click the **OK** button at the bottom of the window to apply your changes

Alternatively, if you have enabled advanced options (see `6.12.1 Advanced download options`_) then the **Post-processing** tab will be visible, and you can do this:

- Click on the **Post-processing** tab
- Select the checkbox **Post-process video files to convert them to audio-only files**
- In the box labelled **Audio format of the post-processed file**, specify what type of audio file you want (**.mp3**, **.wav**, etc)
- If you want, click the button **Keep video file after processing it** to select it
- Click the **OK** button at the bottom of the window to apply your changes

Some websites, such as **YouTube**, allow you to download the audio (in **.m4a** format) directly, without downloading the whole video, and without using **FFmpeg** or **AVconv**.

- In **Tartube**'s main window, click **Edit > General download options... > Formats**
- In the list on the left-hand side, select an **.m4a** format
- Click the **Add format** button to add it to the list on the right
- Click the **OK** button at the bottom of the window to apply your changes

6.23 Classic Mode
-----------------

**Tartube** compiles a database of the videos, channels and playlists it has downloaded.

If you want something simpler, then click the **Classic Mode** tab, which has an interface that looks just like older GUIs.

.. image:: screenshots/example24.png
  :alt: The Classic Mode tab

- Copy and paste the URLs (links) of videos, channels and/or playlists into the box at the top
- Click the **+** button to select a destination. All the videos are downloaded to this location
- Select a video or audio format and resolution, or leave the default settings enabled
- The video might not exist in your preferred format, but if FFmpeg or AVConv is installed on your system, the video can be converted
- Next, click the **Add URLs** button
- If you like, you can add more videos/channels/playlists, using a different destination and/or a different format
- When you're ready, click the **Download all** button

**Tartube** doesn't add any of these videos to its database. When you restart **Tartube**, all of the URLs will be gone. However, the videos themselves will still be on your hard drive.

Because the videos aren't in a database, you can move them anywhere you want (once you've finished downloading them).

Video clips and sliced videos can be created in this tab; see `6.27.3 Video clips in Classic Mode`_. and - see `6.28.3 Video slices in Classic Mode`_.

6.23.1 Customising Classic Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you *only* use this tab, you can tell **Tartube** to open it automatically.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Windows > Main window**
- Select **When Tartube starts, automatically open the Classic Mode tab**

If you don't want **Tartube** to forget URLs when it restarts, you can do this:

- In the **Classic Mode** tab, click the menu button in the top-right corner
- Click **Remember URLs** to select it
- **Tartube** will only remember URLs that haven't been downloaded yet

A separate set of download options (see `6.12 Download options`_) usually applies to the **Classic Mode** tab. You can change this behaviour, if you like.

- Click the menu button in the top-right corner of the tab
- Click **Set download options** to see the complete list of download options
- Alternatively, click **Use default download options** to use the download options called **general**

In the same menu, custom downloads can be enabled (see `6.14 Custom downloads`_). Depending on the behaviour you've selected, **Tartube** may fetch a list of videos from each URL, before downloading them (so don't be alarmed if each URL is 'downloaded' twice).

In the bottom half of the window, you can select one or more URLs by clicking them. The buttons in the bottom-left apply to the selected URLs. Let your mouse hover over a button to see what it does.

6.24 Livestreams
----------------

**Tartube** can detect livestreams, and to notify you when they start. This feature works on **YouTube**, **Odysee** and **Twitch**. It might work on other websites, after a little configuration - see `6.24.5 Compatible websites`_.

**Tartube** can download livestreams while they are broadcasting. If `streamlink <https://streamlink.github.io/>`__ is installed on your system, Tartube can use it; otherwise it will download the livestream using its .m3u manifest.

`Youtube Stream Capture <https://github.com/mrwnwttk/youtube_stream_capture>`__ is deprecated, and **Tartube** no longer supports it.

6.24.1 Detecting livestreams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tartube** searches for livestreams whenever you check or download channels and playlists.

Livestreams are easy to spot. A livestream that hasn't started yet has a red background. A video that's streaming now has a green background. (Livestreams that have finished have a normal background.)

**YouTube** sometimes 'streams' a pre-recorded video at an pre-determined time, as if it were a livestream. These 'debut' or 'premiere' videos are shown in slightly different colours - orange before the stream starts, and cyan while it is in progress.

.. image:: screenshots/example25.png
  :alt: The main window with livestreams visible

Every few minutes, **Tartube** checks whether a livestream (or debut) has started or stopped. This happens automatically in the background; there is no need for you to do anything.

6.24.2 Customising livestreams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can modify how often livestreams are detected. If you are using **yt-dlp**, you can also prevent livestreams from being downloaded at all. Click **Livestreams > Livestream preferences...**.

.. image:: screenshots/example26.png
  :alt: Livestream preferences

For technical reasons, there are practical limits to what **Tartube** can detect. On busy channels, **Tartube** may not be able to detect livestreams that were announced some time ago. Even if you change the number of days from 7 to a very large number, there is no guarantee that **Tartube** will detect everything. (If you change the value to 0, **Tartube** will only detect livestreams that are listed before any ordinary videos.)

By default, **Tartube** checks a livestream every three minutes, waiting for it to start (or stop). When a livestream is due to start, a check happens every minute. Making more frequent checks is probably not a good idea - the video website might block you.

If you want to force a check, in the main window click **Livestreams > Update existing livestreams**. (Checks are silent, so don't worry if nothing seems to be happening).

6.24.3 Livestream notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's really useful to be notified when a livestream is starting. In the same window, click the **Operations > Actions** tab.

.. image:: screenshots/example27.png
  :alt: Livestream actions

**Desktop notifications** do not work on MS Windows.

**Tartube** provides a number of sound effects. You can choose the one you want to use as an alarm. If you want to add your own sound effects, find the directory (folder) where Tartube is installed, copy the new **.mp3** or **.wav** files into **../sounds**, and then restart **Tartube.**

Most users will prefer to leave all of these checkboxes unselected, and instead set up notifications only for the livestreams they want to see.

.. image:: screenshots/example28.png
  :alt: Some example livestreams

- Click **Notify** to show a desktop notification when the stream starts (does not work on MS Windows)
- Click **Alarm** to sound an alarm when the stream starts
- Click **Open** to open the stream in your web browser as soon as it starts
- If you think the stream might be removed from the website, you can click **D/L on start** or **D/L on stop**. If you click both of them, **Tartube** will download the video twice. (Think of the second one as a backup, in case the first download doesn't succeed.)

To disable any of these actions, simply click the same label again.

6.24.4 Downloading livestreams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tartube** can download a livestream while it is still broadcasting. (A livestream that has already finished is treated like any other video.)

There are three different ways to download a livestream. The default method is to use **youtube-dl**, fetching the video's **.m3u** manifest before downloading it.

If `streamlink <https://streamlink.github.io/>`__ is installed on your system, you can use that, instead. MS Windows users can install streamlink from **Tartube**'s main menu (click **Operations > Install streamlink**).

Direct downloads using **youtube-dl** alone are sometimes possible, but are not recommended.

You can choose your preferred method by clicking **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Livestreams**, and selecting one of the three options.

Note that *none of these methods can download a livestream from the very beginning*.

6.24.5 Compatible websites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Livestream downloads should work on most websites. `streamlink <https://streamlink.github.io/>`__ works on most popular websites, but not necessarily on all of them.

**Tartube**'s livestream detection works on **YouTube**, **Odysee** and **Twitch**. It might work on other websites, after a little configuration. Here is how to set that up.

Firstly, find the RSS feed for the channel or playlist. You may have to use a search engine to find out how to do that, but first try `this site <https://fetchrss.com//>`__ and `this one <https://12bytes.org/articles/tech/how-to-access-rss-feeds/>`__.

Secondly, right-click the channel and select **Show > Channel properties...** (alternatively, right-click a playlist and select **Show > Playlist properties...**)

Now click the **RSS feed** tab. Enter the link (URL) to the RSS feed in the box. Click the **OK** button to close the window.

6.25 Detecting missing videos
-----------------------------

**Tartube** can detect videos you have downloaded, but which have been since deleted by the original uploader.

* Click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Missing**
* (If advanced preferences are enabled, then instead click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Preferences**)
* Click the button **Add videos which have been removed from a channel/playlist to the Missing Videos folder** to select it

Having enabled detection, removed videos will appear in the **Missing Videos** folder. To empty that folder, right-click it and select **Folder contents > All contents > Mark as not missing**.

**Tartube** only detects missing videos when checking/downloading whole channels or playlists. If you interrupt a download, no detection occurs.

6.26 More information about FFmpeg and AVConv
---------------------------------------------

6.26.1 Using FFmpeg / AVConv with youtube-dl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you explicitly set the location of the **FFmpeg** and/or **AVConv** executables, then those locations are passed on to **youtube-dl** when you check or download videos.

If *both* locations are set, only one of them is passed on. Usually, that's the location of **FFmpeg**. However, if you specify the **--prefer-avconv** download option, then **AVConv** is passed on, instead.

- Click **Edit > General download options...**
- In the new window, if the **Show advanced download options** button is visible, click it
- Now click the **Post-processing** tab
- Click the **Prefer AVConv over FFmpeg** button to select it
- Make sure the **Prefer FFmpeg over AVConv (default)** button is not selected
- Click **OK** to apply your changes

For more information about download options, see `6.12 Download options`_.

6.26.2 Using FFmpeg directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can process videos and thumbnails with **FFmpeg** directly, if you need to. This is useful for converting a file from one format to another, and for many other tasks.

- Click a video, or select several videos together
- Right-click the video(s) and select **Special > Process with FFmpeg...**
- The FFmpeg options window opens

.. image:: screenshots/example29.png
  :alt: The FFmpeg options window

FFmpeg options behave much like download options.

- You can click the **Show more FFmpeg options** to show advanced options
- One set of FFmpeg options is the *current* one
- If you want to switch to a different set, click **Edit > System preferences... > Options > FFmpeg options**
- FFmpeg options are saved with the **Tartube** database; you can **Export** and **Import** them between databases

The box at the top allows you to add FFmpeg options directly. For example, to convert the framerate of some videos to 24 fps, add the following text:

        **-r 24**

6.26.3 Using FFmpeg options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the options windows, click the **File** tab.

Converting a video from one format to another is as simple as adding the text **avi** or **mkv** (or any other valid video format) to the box **Change file extension**,

The **Videos** tab contains an optional list of videos. These are the videos that are processed, when you click the **Process files** button in the bottom-right corner. (If the list is empty, you will see an **OK** button instead).

You can add videos to this list by dragging and dropping them. Dragging from an external application is allowed, if the videos are also visible somewhere in **Tartube**'s main window (for example, in its database, or in the **Classic Mode** tab).

6.26.4 Advanced FFmpeg options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now click the **Name** tab again. One box shows the **FFmpeg** system command that will be used to process the videos.

If you click the **Show more FFmpeg options** button, you'll notice that the system command changes radically, and that two new tabs have appeared. Go ahead and click the new **Settings** tab.

.. image:: screenshots/example30.png
  :alt: Advanced FFmpeg settings

This tab defines a *source file* and an *output* file.

The source file can be a video, or a thumbnail. If you select **Thumbnail**, then FFmpeg will process the thumbnails associated with videos listed in the **Videos** tab; otherwise, it will process the video files themselves.

The **Output** setting defines whatever you're trying to achieve. If you want **FFmpeg** to produce a video, then **H.264** is the most useful setting (but you could also choose **GIF**).

When youtube-dl downloads a video, it often downloads the video and audio components seperately. The two pieces are then merged by FFmpeg. Usually, all of this happens automatically, but if the merge didn't succeed (or wasn't attempted), you can try again by selecting **Merge video/audio**. This settings expects to find a video file and an audio file with the same name (but with different file extensions).

If the source file is a thumbnail, then the output file must also be a thumbnail.

6.27 Video clips
----------------

**Tartube** can create video clips by downloading parts of a video. It can also split up a video it has already downloaded. This functionality requires **FFmpeg**.

**Tartube** can extract a list of timestamps from a video's description. It can also extract the chapter list from a video's metadata (**.info.json**) file. If you prefer, you can specify your own timestamps. Using this data, you can create video clips of any length.

Both video clips and the original video are normally added to **Tartube**'s database. Of course, if you create clips in the **Classic Mode** tab, then they won't be added to the database - see `6.27.3 Video clips in Classic Mode`_.

It's important to be aware of the limitations of this feature.

- Downloading video clips might take longer than downloading the full video
- Some video formats cannot be divided into clips accurately. **.mp4** is much better than **.webm**. If you want to download video clips, we recommend downloading in **.mp4** format
- If you want clips that start and end at a particular frame, **Tartube** is not a suitable tool. Use a dedicated video editor instead

6.27.1 Video clip preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start, take a look at **Tartube**'s video clip preferences (click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Clips**).

- It will save a lot of time if you let **Tartube** automatically extract timestamps, so most users should enable that
- Video clips are stored in the **Video Clips** folder by default, but you can store them alongside the original video, if you prefer
- Video clips can be added to **Tartube**'s database, either alongside or instead of the original video
- If you're going to make a lot of video clips, you can store them in a sub-folder (one for each original video)

If your database already contains a lot of videos, you can ask **Tartube** to extract timestamps from their descriptions or metadata.

- Click **Edit > System preferences > Files > Updates**
- Click the button **Extract timestamps for all videos**

If you prefer to update videos one at a time, right-click the video and select **Show video > Properties... > Timestamps**. Then click the button **Reset list using video description**.

6.27.2 Quick video clips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After checking or downloading a video, you can right-click it and select **Special > Create video clips...**

.. image:: screenshots/example34.png
  :alt: Create video clips window

The new dialogue window contains a lot of buttons, but it's actually quite simple.

- First, choose what you want to do

If you have already downloaded a video, you can select **Create clips from the downloaded video**. However, it is often quicker just to download the clips you want.

There are two options for downloading clips. For some users, downloading with **yt-dlp** might produce better results than downloading with **FFmpeg**, but you can use whichever method you prefer.

- Creating a single clip

A timestamp is in the form **15:29**, meaning 15 minutes and 29 seconds, or **1:15:29**, meaning 1 hour, 15 minutes and 29 seconds.

Each video clip is represented by two timestamps: a start and a stop timestamp. The start timestamp is compulsory. The stop timestamp is optional; if it isn't specified, then the video clip will end at the beginning of the *next* video clip (or at the end of the video, if there are no more.)

If you already know the start and stop timestamps for your clip, you can use this **Download one clip** / **Create one clip** section. Enter the timestamps, enter a clip title, and then click the **Download clip** / **Create clip** button. The procedure will begin immediately.

- Creating multiple clips

When you use the **Download one clip** / **Create one clip** section, the timestamps are forgotten as soon as the procedure is finished. In the section below, any timestamps you add are stored in Tartube's database permanently. (You can see them by right-clicking a video and selecting **Show video > Properties... > Timestamps**).

If you don't already see a list of timestamps in the window, you can click the **Reset list using video description** button. If this doesn't work, you will have to add the timestamps yourself.

When you're ready, you can click one of the buttons at the bottom of the window.

**Download all clips** / **Create all clips** will use all of the clips in the list. **Download marked clips** / **Create marked clips** will use only the clips you have marked. To mark a clip, select the small button on the left edge of the row.

**Download all chapters** is only available when you have selected **Download new clips using yt-dlp**. It uses **yt-dlp**'s built-in ability to download separate video chapters; the timestamps in the list above are ignored.

6.27.3 Video clips in Classic Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, video clips created in the **Classic Mode** tab are not added to **Tartube**'s database.

To download video clips, click the **Add video clips** button. The dialogue window is similar to the one described above, but you will have to add the original video's URL. (Make sure you use the URL for a single video, not one for a channel or a playlist.)

It's a good idea to add a name for the original video, too; this will help to prevent duplicate file names.

When you click one of the **Download** buttons, the dialogue window disappears, and a line is added to the list at the bottom of the tab. Set up more downloads, if you like; when you've finished, click the **Download all** button.

If you want to create video clips from a video you've already downloaded, or if you want to download new clips without re-entering the URL, you can right-click the same line and select **Create video clips...**

6.27.4 Frequent video clip downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you frequently create video clips, then you should set up custom downloads (see `6.14 Custom downloads`_).

- Open the window for your preferred custom download. For example, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Custom**, click **general** to select it, and click the **Edit** button
- Click **Download each video independently of its channel or playlist** to select it
- Now click the **Clips** tab
- You can now select **Split videos into video clips using timestamps (requires FFmpeg)**
- Click **OK** to close the window

The next step is to check any videos, channels and playlists (for example by clicking the big **Check all** button in the **Videos** tab).

This will fetch information about the videos. In many cases, a video's description will include a list of timestamps, and in other cases the video's metadata will include a list of chapters. Assuming that you enabled the auto-extract settings (as described above), that information will have been extracted. If not, you can enter some timestamps manually: right-click a video, and select **Show video > Properties > Timestamps**.

When you're ready, perform a custom download in the normal way (for example, by clicking **Operations > Custom download all**). Videos will be downloaded as a series of video clips. (If no timestamps have been specified, then the video is downloaded whole.)

Don't forget that custom downloads can be enabled in the **Classic Mode** tab, if you need them. Before downloading, click the menu button in the top-right corner of the tab, and select **Enable custom downloads**.

6.27.5 Extracting video clips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an alternative way of splitting into clips a video you've already downloaded. This method allows advanced users to customise **FFmpeg**'s behaviour during the splitting process.

- Right click the video, and select **Special > Process with FFmpeg...**
- If the **Clips** tab is visible, click it
- Otherwise, the **Settings** tab will be visible. Click it, then in the **Output** line, select **Video clip**

You can split a video using the timestamps already extracted. In the **Clips** tab (if visible), you can select **Split videos using these timestamps** to specify your own timestamps. The second method is useful if FFmpeg is acting on multiple videos at the same time.

When you're ready to go, click the **Process files** button.

6.28 Video slices
-----------------

Unwanted parts of a video, such as adverts and intro/outro music, are called video **slices**.

**Tartube** can download a video with the slices removed. It can also remove slices from a video you have already downloaded. This functionality requires **FFmpeg**.

**Tartube** contacts a `SponsorBlock <https://sponsor.ajay.app/>`__ server to get a list of video slices. Not all videos have been added to the SponsorBlock database, so you can also specify your own slices when necessary.

It's important to be aware of the limitations of this feature.

- Downloading and slicing a video might take longer than a normal download. In some cases, it might be quicker just to skip over (or watch!) the adverts
- Some video formats cannot be sliced accurately. **.mp4** is much better than **.webm**. If you want to remove slices, we recommend downloading videos in **.mp4** format
- If you want to remove slices starting and ending at a particular frame, **Tartube** is not a suitable tool. Use a dedicated video editor instead

6.28.1 Video slice preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start, take a look at **Tartube**'s video slice preferences (click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Slices**).

- It will save a lot of time if you let **Tartube** contact **SponsorBlock** automatically, every time a video is checked or downloaded
- Obfuscating the video's ID is recommended to protect your privacy. **SponsorBlock** will not know for sure which video you're looking for, so it will send data for a range of videos; **Tartube** will ignore the extra data

If you want to update a video, you can right-click it and select **Check video**, which will update the video and contact **SponsorBlock** for a second time.

6.28.2 Quick video slices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After checking or downloading a video, you can right-click it and then select **Special > Remove video slices...**

.. image:: screenshots/example35.png
  :alt: Remove video slices window

The new dialogue window contains a lot of buttons, but it's actually quite simple.

- First, choose what you want to do

If you have already downloaded a video, you can select **Remove slices from the downloaded video**. However, it is sometimes quicker just to download the a new copy of the video with the slices removed, in which case, you should select **Download new sliced video**.

- Removing a single slice

A timestamp is in the form **15:29**, meaning 15 minutes and 29 seconds, or **1:15:29**, meaning 1 hour, 15 minutes and 29 seconds.

Each video slice is represented by two values: a start and a stop value. You can use a timestamp, or a value in seconds. The start value is compulsory. The stop value is optional; if it isn't specified, then the video slice will end at the beginning of the *next* video slice (or at the end of the video, if there are no more.)

If you already know the start and stop values for your slice, you can use this **Download sliced video** / **Create sliced video** section. Enter the values and then click the **Download sliced video** / **Create sliced video** button. The procedure will begin immediately.

- Removing multiple slices

When you use the **Download video with one slice** / **Create video with one slice** section, the time values are forgotten as soon as the procedure is finished. In the section below, any time values you add are stored in **Tartube**'s database permanently. (You can see them by right-clicking a video and selecting **Show video > Properties... > Slices**).

If you don't already see a list of time values in the window, you can click the **Contact SponsorBlock to reset list** button. If this doesn't work, you will have to add the time values yourself.

SponsorBlock categorises video slices, distinguishing between (for example) adverts and intro music. In this window, it is not necessary to choose a category before clicking the **Add slice** button, since you'll be choosing for yourself which slices to remove.

When you're ready, you can click one of the buttons at the bottom of the window.

**Download video, removing all slices** / **Create video, removing all slices** will use all of the slices in the list. **Download video, removing marked slices** / **Create video, removing marked slices** will use only the slices you have marked. To mark a slice, select the small button on the left edge of the row.

6.28.3 Video slices in Classic Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned above, sliced videos created in the **Classic Mode** tab are not added to **Tartube**'s database.

Removing video slices in the **Classic Mode** tab is very simple; it is essentially an on/off setting. To enable it, select the **Use SponsorBlock** button.

This setting will not work at all unless you are using **yt-dlp**, and at least **FFmpeg** v5.1+. (Note that, at the time of writing, many users will have an older version of FFmpeg installed on their system.)

6.28.4 Frequent sliced video downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you frequently remove slices from videos, then you should set up custom downloads (see `6.14 Custom downloads`_).

- Open the window for your preferred custom download. For example, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Custom**, click **general** to select it, and click the **Edit** button
- In the new window, click **Download each video independently of its channel or playlist** to select it
- Now click the **Slices tab**
- You can now select **Remove slices from the video using SponsorBlock data**
- Select which types of slice you want to remove by clicking the small box on the left edge of each row
- When you're ready, click **OK** to close the window

The next step is to check any videos, channels and playlists (for example by clicking the **Check all** button in the **Videos** tab).

This will fetch information about the videos. Assuming that you allowed Tartube to contact SponsorBlock automatically (as described above), some of those videos will now have a red icon next to them, indicating that a list of slices has been obtained. If not, you can enter some slices manually: right-click a video, and select **Show video > Properties > Slices**.

Each video slice is represented by four properties:

- The start and stop times, in seconds or expressed as timestamps
- The stop time is optional. If you don't specify it, the end of the video is used
- **Category** is the type of slice; for example, a **sponsor** slice is an advert
- At the moment, there is only one **Action type** available: **skip** means to remove the slice from the video

When you're ready, perform a custom download in the normal way (for example, by clicking **Operations > Custom download all**). Tartube will download the video as a sequence of video clips, before concatenating (joining) them together into a single video. (If no slices have been specified, then the video is downloaded whole.)

Don't forget that custom downloads can be enabled in the **Classic Mode** tab, if you need them. Before downloading, click the menu button in the top-right corner of the tab, and select **Enable custom downloads**.

6.28.5 Extracting video slices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is an alternative way of removing slices from a video you've already downloaded. This method allows advanced users to customise FFmpeg's behaviour during the slicing process.

- Right click the video, and select **Special > Process with FFmpeg...**
- If the **Slices** tab is visible, click it
- Otherwise, the **Settings** tab will be visible. Click it, then in the **Output** line, select **Video slice**

You can slice a video using SponsorBlock data already obtained. In the **Slices** tab (if visible), you can select **Use this slice data** to specify your own video slices. The second option is useful if FFmpeg is acting on multiple videos at the same time.

When you're ready to go, click the **Process files** button.

6.29 Using youtube-dl forks
---------------------------

`youtube-dl <https://youtube-dl.org/>`__ is open-source software, and there are a number of forks available. Tartube officially supports both the original version and `yt-dlp <https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp>`__.

If a **youtube-dl** fork is still compatible with the original, then **Tartube** can use it instead of the original.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Downloaders > Forks**
- In the box **Other forks**, enter the name of the fork
- Click **OK** to close the preferences window
- Now click **Operations > Update <fork>**, which will download (or update) the fork on your system

6.30 Video comments
-------------------

**yt-dlp** can retrieve a video's comments (**youtube-dl** cannot, currently).

The comments are written to the video's metadata (**.info.json**) file. **Tartube** can also store a copy of the comments in its database.

Fetching comments will increase the length of a download, perhaps by a lot. Adding comments to Tartube's database may increase its size *dramatically*, meaning that on startup, the database takes much longer to load.

This is how to enable comment fetching.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Downloaders > Forks**, and make sure **yt-dlp** is selected
- Click the OK button to close that window
- Now click **Edit > General download options...**
- If the **Show advanced download options** button is visible, click it
- Now click the **Downloads > Comments** tab
- Select **When checking videos, store comments in the metadata file**
- You can also select **When downloading videos, store comments in the metadata file**
- You can also select **Also store comments in the Tartube database**

By default, the metadata file isn't kept permanently. If you want a permanent archive of video comments, you should do this:

- Click **Edit > General download options... > Files > Write/move**
- Make sure **Write video's metadata to an .info.json file** is selected
- Now click the tab **Keep**
- Make sure the two **Keep the metadata file** buttons are selected

Comments can be loaded from the metadata file into the Tartube database at any time.

- Right-click a video, and select **Show video > Properties... > Comments**
- If the metadata file exists, you can click the button **Update from the metadata file**

Alternatively, you can update the entire database at once. (This may take a long time.)

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Files > Update**
- Click the button **Extract comments for all videos**

6.31 Dark themes on MS Windows
------------------------------

On Linux and MacOS, Tartube will automatically assume the desktop theme (whatever it is). That isn't technically possible on MS Windows, but if you want a darker window to match your darker desktop theme, do this:

- Click **System > Change theme...**
- In the new window's drop-down box, select **dark**, and click the **OK** button
- Restart Tartube to apply the darker theme

If you really want to, it's possible to add more themes to the small selection included in the MS Windows installer.

First, select a suitable theme pack. Tartube's installer includes `this one <https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10-Dark>`__. Let's imagine a future installer that *doesn't* include that particular theme pack; this is how you would add it.

- Locate Tartube's script folder. In Tartube's menu, click **System > Show Tartube script folder**
- Navigate to the **\\pack\\mswin_themes** folder
- Each of these folders specifies the name of a theme. Create a new folder called **dark**
- Inside that folder, create a file called **settings.ini**
- Open the file in a text editor, and add these lines:

        [Settings]

        gtk-theme-name=Windows10

Note that **Windows10** is the name of the theme pack, not the name of your operating system.

- Re-start Tartube
- Click **System > Change theme...**
- Your **dark** should be visible in the drop-down box

Now you must install the theme pack itself at the correct location.

- Download the theme pack from the link above
- Extract it, and navigate to the **gtk-3.20** folder. The files inside this folder are the ones you need to copy
- Next, in Tartube's menu, click **System > Show Tartube install folder**
- In the new window, navigate to **msys64\\mingw64\\share\\themes**
- Create a folder called **Windows10**, matching the theme pack's name
- Inside that folder, create a folder called **gtk-3.0**
- Copy the files from the theme pack's **gtk-3.20** folder into this new **gtk-3.0** folder

You can now set the theme from Tartube's menu.

7.1 Tartube won't install/won't run/doesn't work
------------------------------------------------

*Q: I can't install Tartube / I can't run Tartube / Tartube doesn't work properly!*

A: See `7.24 Doesn't work on 32-bit Windows / Windows 7 / Windows 8`_

A: See also `7.2 Update Tartube on MS Windows`_

A: On Linux, if the DEB or RPM package doesn't work, try installing via PyPI: `5.3.5 Install using PyPI`_

A: Please report any problems to the authors at our `Github page <https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues>`__.

As of v2.4.108, most system errors should be visible in Tartube's main window (in the **Errors/Warnings** tab). If not, it may be necessary to run Tartube from inside a terminal window in order to see the errors

On MS Windows, this is how to run **Tartube** from inside a terminal window:

- In Tartube's main menu, select **System > Show Tartube install folder**
- After the folder window opens, shut down Tartube
- In the folder window, click the **msys64** folder to open it
- (For users of Tartube's portable edition, the corresponding folder is called **tartube**)
- Open the terminal by double-clicking **mingw64.exe**
- In this window, type these commands to start **Tartube** (paying attention to the *forward* slashes):

        **cd /home/user/tartube**

        **python3 -X utf8 tartube/tartube**

7.2 Update Tartube on MS Windows
--------------------------------

*Q: You told me I need to update my Windows installation, how do I do that?*

A: New installers for MS Windows are not released frequently, but small updates and fixes *are* uploaded frequently to `Github <https://github.com/axcore/tartube/>`__. You can update your Tartube installation quite easily.

- Download the latest source code from `Github <https://github.com/axcore/tartube/>`__
- In Tartube's main menu, select **System > Show Tartube script folder**
- A folder opens containing files such as **setup.py** and **README.rst**
- Copy the downloaded source code into this folder, replacing old files with new ones
- Restart Tartube

7.3 "Download did not start" error
----------------------------------

*Q: When I try to download videos, nothing happens! In the Errors/Warnings tab, I can see "Download did not start"!*

A: See `6.3 Setting the downloader's location`_

7.4 Can't download a video
--------------------------

*Q: I can't download the video!*

A: Make sure **youtube-dl** is updated; see `6.2 Updating the downloader`_

Before submitting a `bug report <https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues>`__, find out whether **Tartube** is responsible for the problem, or not. You can do this by opening a terminal window, and typing something like this:

**youtube-dl <url>**

...where **\<url\>** is the address of the video. If the video downloads successfully, then it's a **Tartube** problem that you can report. If it doesn't download, you should submit a bug report to the authors of the downloader instead. (You could also try a different downloader.)

Because most people don't like typing, **Tartube** offers a shortcut.

- Click **Operations > Test youtube-dl**, or right-click a video, and select **Downloads > Test system command**
- In the dialogue window, enter the link (URL) to the video
- You can add more **youtube-dl** download options, if you want. See `here <https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/>`__ for a complete list of them
- Click the **OK** button to close the window and begin the test
- Click the **Output** tab to watch the test as it progresses
- When the test is finished, a temporary directory (folder) opens, containing anything that **youtube-dl** was able to download

7.5 Downloads never finish
--------------------------

*Q: I clicked the 'Download all' button and it starts, but never finishes!*

A: This generally indicates an error in the Python, Gtk and/or **Tartube** code. The error should be visible in the Errors/Warnings tab. See `7.1 Tartube won't install/won't run/doesn't work`_).

7.6 Videos are missing after a crash
------------------------------------

*Q: After I downloaded some videos, Tartube crashed, and now all my videos are missing!*

A: **Tartube** creates a backup copy of its database, before trying to save a new copy. In the unlikely event of a failure, you can replace the broken database file with the backup file.

- Open the data directory (folder). If you're not sure where to find **Tartube**'s data directory, you can click **Edit > System preferences... > Files > Database**
- Make sure **Tartube** is not running. The **Tartube** window is sometimes minimised, and sometimes only visible in the system tray
- In the data directory is the broken **tartube.db** file. You should rename to something else, in case you want to examine it later
- In the same directory, you might be able to see a directory called **.backups**
- If **.backups** is not visible, then it is hidden. (On many Linux and BSD systems, pressing **CTRL + H** will reveal hidden directories)
- Inside the **.backups** directory, you'll find some backup copies of the database file
- Choose the most recent one, copy it into the directory above, and rename the copy as **tartube.db**, replacing the old broken file
- Restart **Tartube**
- Click the **Check All** button. **Tartube** will update its database with any videos you've downloaded that were not in the backup database file

**Tartube** can make more frequent backups of your database file, if you want. See the options in **Edit > System preferences... > Files > Backups**.

Note that **Tartube** does not create backup copies of the videos you've downloaded. That is your responsibility!

7.7 Tartube database is broken
------------------------------

*Q: The Tartube database is totally broken! How do I rebuild it? I don't want to download everything again!*

A: If **Tartube** is able to load the database at all, then there is a built-in database repair tool. Click **File > Check database integrity**

A: Try loading one of the database backups - see `7.6 Videos are missing after a crash`_

A: If the database file (**tartube.db**) is not actually corrupted, you can extract a list of channels and playlists from it. The list is exported as a JSON file.

To create the export, click **File > Database preferences > Dump database to JSON**.

The export can then be re-imported into your current database in the normal way (see `6.21.4 Exporting/importing the database`_).

A: Earlier versions of **Tartube** did in fact introduce occasional blips into the database. It's possible (though unlikely) that some blips still exist, despite the best efforts of the authors. If you really want to rebuild the database from scratch, this is how to do it.

Firstly, click **Media > Export/import > Export from database...**.

In the dialogue window, it's not necessary to select the button **Include lists of videos**. Click the **OK** button. Let Tartube create the backup file. You now have a backup of the names and URLs for every channel/playlist you've added.

Next, shut down **Tartube**.

**Tartube's** data folder contains the database file, **tartube.db**. Rename it (don't delete it).

Now you can restart **Tartube**. **Tartube** will create a brand new database file.

Click **Media > Export/import > Import into database...** and select the file you created moments ago.

All the channels/playlists should now be visible in the main window. Click the **Check All** button in the bottom-left corner and wait for it to finish.

Your new database now contains information about all the videos, but it doesn't know that most of those videos have been downloaded already. Click **Operations > Refresh database...** to take care of that.

A: Database files created by **Tartube** v1.1.0 and earlier cannot be loaded due to serialisation issues. There is possibly no way to fix this.

7.8 'Check all' button takes too long
-------------------------------------

*Q: I clicked the 'Check all' button, but the operation takes so long! It only found two new videos!*

A: By default, the underlying **youtube-dl** software checks an entire channel, even if it contains thousands of videos.

You can drastically reduce the time this takes by telling **Tartube** to stop checking/downloading videos, if it receives (for example) details about three videos it has already checked/downloaded.

This works well on sites like YouTube, which send information about videos in the order they were uploaded, newest first. We can't guarantee it will work on every site.

- Click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Stop**
- Select the checkbox **Stop checking/downloading a channel/playlist when it finds videos you already have**
- In the **Stop after this many videos (when checking)** box, enter a number (or keep the current number)
- In the **Stop after this many videos (when downloading)** box, enter a number
- Click **OK** to close the window

7.9 'Download all' button takes too long
----------------------------------------

*Q: I clicked the 'Download all' button. The whole operation took so long, even though Tartube only downloaded two  new videos!*

A: **youtube-dl** can create an archive file. The archive file remembers which videos have been downloaded, so that **youtube-dl** can skip them (which saves a lot of time).

To enable this functionality, click **Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Archive** and select **Allow downloader to create its own archive file**.

(If the **Archive** tab is not visible, select the **General > Application** tab, and then click the **Show advanced preferences** button.)

By default, the archive file is stored in the same folder as the video, but you can change this behaviour, if you like.

- Click **Store the archive file in Tartube's data directory** to create a single archive file that applies to every video, channel and playlist in Tartube's database
- Click **Store the archive file at this location** to create an archive file somewhere else, then click **Set** to choose a folder

7.10 Channel downloads one video at a time
------------------------------------------

*Q: In the Progress tab, 'Max downloads' is set to 2. But when I download my favourite channel, it downloads only one video at a time!*

When you add a channel (or a playlist), **Tartube** knows the URL of the channel, but it doesn't know anything about the videos inside it. Therefore it passes the URL of the channel to **youtube-dl**. Therefore the channel is downloaded, one video at a time.

You can download multiple videos from the same channel simultaneously, if you want (but it probably won't speed up your overall download).

- Right-click the channel and select **Check channel**
- When the operation finishes, Tartube will know the URL of each video
- In the list of videos, select every video (press **CTRL + A**)
- Right-click one of the videos, and select **Download videos**

Alternatively, you can use custom downloads (see `6.14 Custom downloads`_).

7.11 Tartube database file is getting in the way
------------------------------------------------

*Q: Tartube stores its database file in the same place as its videos. Why can't I store them in different places?*

A: This question has been asked by several people who were storing their videos on some remote filesystem (perhaps in the so-called 'cloud'). They found that the videos could be downloaded to that remote location, but that Tartube couldn't save its database file there.

At the moment, the answer is '**Tartube** is working fine, fix your own computer'. Perhaps in the future, someone will think of an urgent need for the database file and the data folder to be split up. Until then, there are a number of good reasons for keeping them together:

- If the database file exists in the folder, **Tartube** can be confident that it's downloading videos to the place you actually intended
- If **Tartube** can't read/write its own database file, that probably means that it won't be possible to store any videos, thumbnails, descriptions, and so on
- **Tartube** actually creates a number of temporary files at this location, most of which are invisible but need to be in the same place as the videos
- If you want to move your videos from one location to another, it's easy - just move a single directory (folder) and everything it contains. There is no need to reconfigure anything; just tell **Tartube** where to find the new directory (folder)
- Splitting up the data folder and the database file would require a lot of code to be rewritten, and this would probably introduce lots of new bugs

7.12 Duplicate video names
--------------------------

*Q: I downloaded a channel, but some of the videos in the channel have the same name. Tartube only downloads one of them!*

A: Tartube can create files with names in different formats. The name of two videos might be identical, but each video will have a unique ID, so you can add the ID to the filename.

- Click **Edit > General download options... > Files > File names**
- In the box **Format for video file names**, select **Title + ID**
- Click **OK** to close the window

7.13 Convert video to audio
---------------------------

*Q: I want to convert the video files to audio files!*

A: See `6.22 Converting to audio`_

7.14 Video is downloaded as separate video/audio files
------------------------------------------------------

*Q: I downloaded a video and expected a single video file, instead Tartube downloaded several files, none of which are playable!*

*Q: I set the download option 'If a merge is required after post-processing, output to this format', but it doesn't work!*

A: The solution to both problems is to install FFmpeg, and to set the output format correctly.

Firstly, make sure FFmpeg is installed on your system - see `6.4 Installing FFmpeg / AVConv`_.

Secondly, set your desired output format. Open the Download options window (for example, click **Edit > General download options... > Formats**). Add a format like **mp4** to the **List of preferred formats**, then add the same format to **If a merge is required after post-processing, output to this format**.

For some reason, youtube-dl ignores the download option unless the format is specified in both places. (You will see a warning if you forget.)

.. image:: screenshots/example31.png
  :alt: The Download options window

Tartube can merge a video and audio file together, long after they have been downloaded - see `6.26 More information about FFmpeg and AVConv`_.

7.15 Too many folders in the main window
----------------------------------------

*Q: The main window is full of folders I never use! I can't see my own channels, playlists and folders!*

A: In the main window's toolbar, click the **Hide (most) system folders** button (a red folder)

A: In the main menu, click **Media > Show/hide > Hide (most) system folders**

A: Right-click the folders you don't want to see, and select **Folder actions > Hide folder**. To reverse this step, in the main menu click **Media > Show/hide > Show hidden folders**

A: In the main menu, click **Edit > System preferences... > Windows > Videos**, and click **Show smaller icons** to select it

A: If you have many channels and playlists, create a folder, and then drag-and-drop some channels/playlists into it

7.16 Not enough videos in the main window
-----------------------------------------

*Q: I want to see all the videos on a single page, not spread over several pages!*

A: In the toolbar at the bottom of the **Videos** tab, set the page size to zero, and press **ENTER**.

7.17 Toolbar is too small
-------------------------

*Q: The toolbar is too small! There isn't enough room for all the buttons!*

A: Click **Edit > System preferences... > Windows > Main window** and then click **Don't show labels in the main window toolbar** to select it.

MS Windows users can already see a toolbar without labels.

7.18 Toolbar is too big
-----------------------

*Q: The toolbar is too big! Make it go away!*

A: Click **Edit > System preferences... > Windows > Main window**, and then click **Don't show the main window toolbar**. The new setting is applied when you restart **Tartube**.

7.19 YouTube name/password not accepted
---------------------------------------

*Q: I added my YouTube username and password, but I am still seeing authentification errors!*

A: The questioner is talking about the settings in **Edit > General download options... > Advanced > Authentication**.

This is a **youtube-dl** issue. A general solution is described in `this post <https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/21313#issuecomment-499496235>`__.

The solution describes how to create a cookies.txt file, which can be specified as a download option.

Having created the file, in the same edit window, click the **Name** tab. In the box labelled **Additional download options**, you can add:

**--cookies=YT-cookies.txt**

See also the **Tartube** thread `here <https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/68>`__.

7.20 Georestriction workarounds don't work
------------------------------------------

*Q: I want to download a video, but it's blocked in my region. I set the geostriction workarounds, but I still can't download the video!*

A: **youtube-dl** provides some options for bypassing region-blocking. To show them, click **Edit > General download options...**

Click the **Show advanced download options** button if it's visible, then click the tabs **Advanced > Geo-restriction**.

Unfortunately, although these options exist, websites are not compelled to respect them. **YouTube**, in particular, may completely ignore them.

In many cases, the only remedy is to buy a subscription to a `VPN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network>`__ (or to the video website itself).

7.21 Video website blocks me
----------------------------

*Q: I downloaded some videos from a channel, but then YouTube blocked me, and I can't download the rest of them!*

A: Change your IP address and try again.

A: Subscribe to a `VPN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network>`__.

A: You can specify a list of proxies (**Edit > System preferences... > Operations > Proxies**). During a download operation, **Tartube** will cycle between these proxies.

Unfortunately, it is not possible to switch between proxies while downloading a channel (**youtube-dl** does not offer that functionality). But the proxy list will work well if you're trying to download ten different channels.

7.22 Too many blocked videos
----------------------------

*Q: The Videos tab is full of 'blocked' videos!*

.. image:: screenshots/example32.png
  :alt: A selection of blocked videos

A: If Tartube detects a video that has been age-restricted, censored or otherwise blocked, it is still added to the database. Unfortunately, Tartube doesn't know anything about the video, not even when it was uploaded, so videos like this appear at the top of the list.

If you don't want to see blocked videos in the **Videos** tab, deselect the button in the toolbar. (If you're not sure how to use the toolbar, see see `6.16 Filtering and finding videos`_.)

If you don't want the blocked videos added to your database at all, you can click **Edit > System preferences > Operations > Downloads**, and then de-select **Add censored, age-restricted and other blocked videos to the database**

7.23 MS Windows installer is too big
------------------------------------

*Q: Why is the Windows installer so big?*

A: **Tartube** is a Linux application. The installer for MS Windows contains not just **Tartube** itself, but a copy of Python and a whole bunch of essential graphics libraries, all of them ported to MS Windows.

Installing `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__ will dramatically increase the size of the installed folder.

If you're at all suspicious that such a small application uses such a large installer, you are invited to examine the installed files for yourself:

- In Tartube's main menu, select **System > Show Tartube install folder**

Everything is copied into this single folder. The installer doesn't modify the Windows registry, nor does it install files anywhere else (other than to the desktop and the Start Menu).

The NSIS scripts used to create the installers can be found here:

- In Tartube's main menu, select **System > Show Tartube script folder**
- Click the **nsis** folder to open it

The scripts contain full instructions, so you should be able to create your own installer and then compare it to the official one.

7.24 Doesn't work on 32-bit Windows / Windows 7 / Windows 8
-----------------------------------------------------------

*Q: Tartube does not install/work on my ancient computer!*

A: MSYS2 has dropped support for older Windows systems. As of November 2023, the minimum requirement is `64bit Windows 8.1 / Windows Server 2012 R2 <https://www.msys2.org/docs/windows_support/>`__.

Tartube cannot be run on any 32-bit Windows system.

Tartube can be run on Windows 7 and Windows 8, but you will need to use an `older installer <https://sourceforge.net/projects/tartube/files/v2.4.386/install-tartube-with-ffmpeg-2.4.386-64bit.exe/download>`__.

After running the installer, you can manually update Tartube to the most recent version, as described here: `7.2 Update Tartube on MS Windows`_.

7.25 Tartube can't detect livestreams
-------------------------------------

*Q: Tartube can't detect upcoming livestreams at all!*

A: Click **Edit > System preferences... General > Modules**.

If the `Python feedparser module <https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/>`__ is not available, you can install it via PyPI. On Linux/BSD, the command to use is something like:

**pip3 install feedparser**

The Tartube installer for 64-bit MS Windows already contains a copy of **feedparser**, so there is no need to install it again.

7.26 Livestream is already finished
-----------------------------------

*Q: Tartube is showing a livestream that finished hours/days/centuries ago!*

A: Right-click the video and select **Livestream > Not a livestream**.

7.27 Can't hear livestream alarms
---------------------------------

*Q: I set an alarm for an upcoming livestream, but I didn't hear anything!*

A: Obviously you have already checked that your speakers are turned on, so now click **Edit > System preferences... > General > Modules**.

If the `Python playsound module <https://pypi.org/project/playsound/>`__ is not available, you can install it via PyPI. On Linux/BSD, the command to use is something like:

**pip3 install playsound**

The Tartube installer for 64-bit MS Windows already contains a copy of **playsound**, so there is no need to install it again.

7.28 Some icons not visible
---------------------------

*Q: Icons in the Videos tab are broken! They all look the same!*

*Q: Icons in the Classic Mode tab are broken! They all look the same!*

A: Since v2.4, **Tartube** uses a set of custom icons, replacing system (stock) icons. This was because some users were complaining that their (broken) systems didn't provide the stock icons.

If you want to restore stock icons, click **Edit > System preferences... > Windows > Main window** and then click **Replace stock icons with custom icons (in case stock icons are not visible)** to deselect it. Click the **OK** button to close the window, then restart **Tartube**.

7.29 Video thumbnails not visible
---------------------------------

*Q: Tartube doesn't download video thumbnails any more! It used to work fine!*

A: In June 2020, **YouTube** changed its image format from **.jpg** to **.webp**. Unfortunately, most software (including the graphics libraries used by **Tartube**) don't support **.webp** images yet. Worse still, **YouTube** begain sending **.webp** thumbnails mislabelled as **.jpg** files.

In September 2020, **Tartube** and **youtube-dl** added separate fixes for this problem. These fixes both depend on `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__, so they won't work if FFmpeg is not installed on your system - see `6.4 Installing FFmpeg / AVConv`_.

If you have already downloaded a lot of **.webp** images, you can ask **Tartube** to convert them back to **.jpg**. Once converted, they will be visible in the main window.

* Click **Operations > Tidy up files...**
* In the dialogue window, click **Convert .webp files to .jpg using FFmpeg** to select it, then click the **OK** button

7.30 Video text not visible
---------------------------

*Q: I can't see the text below each video!*

A: If the background colours in the **Videos** and **Drag and Drop** tabs are getting in the way, you can change them: click **Edit > Sysem preferences... > Windows > Colours**.

7.31 Graphs not visible
-----------------------

*Q: My buddy installed Tartube, and he showed me some download history graphs. But when I looked for that on my computer, I couldn't find them!*

A: Tartube shows download statistics in a number of places, for example **Edit > System preferences... > Files > History**.

The graphs are created by `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`__, but none of the Tartube installers include it (because it's quite a large download). If you want graphs, you have to install matplotlib yourself.

On Linux/BSD, use your system's software manager.

On MS Windows, click **Operations > Install matplotlib...**

7.32 Tartube is not visible in the system tray
----------------------------------------------

*Q: Tartube is not visible in the system tray! There is just an empty space where the Tartube icon should be!*

A: This problem exists on certain Linux desktop environments (e.g. `Cinnamon <https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon>`__) which have still not fixed an ancient bug. The bug is related to a message you might be able to see in a terminal window:

*gdk_window_thaw_toplevel_updates: assertion 'window->update_and_descendants_freeze_count > 0' failed*.

Other desktop environments (e.g. `MATE <https://mate-desktop.org/>`__) display the **Tartube** icon correctly.

7.33 Tartube is not portable
----------------------------

*Q: I want to install Tartube on a USB stick. How do I make Tartube portable?*

A: On MS Windows, download the portable edition rather than the usual installer - see `5.1 Installation - MS Windows`_.

A: On other operating systems, just download the source code and run it. Installation is not necessary (as long as you have installed the correct dependencies) - see `5.3.10 Run without installing`_.

**Tartube** looks for a configuration file in two places: firstly, the directory (folder) containing the source code (the one that contains a **setup.py** file), and then, the default location for the system.

If it doesn't find a configuration file in either location, it creates one in the default location for your system.

However, you can create an empty **settings.json** file in the source code directory. If **Tartube** sees that empty file, it starts writing config files to that location, rather than to the default location. The source code directory is now truly portable, since when you move it somewhere, its configuration file moves with it.

You can see both locations by clicking **Edit > System preferences... > Files > Config**.

7.34 Run out of disk space
--------------------------

*Q: When I try to download videos, Tartube refuses, complaining "You have only X / Y Mb remaining on your device". But I'm using an external hard drive with over a trillion terabytes of empty space!*

A: Some users have reported that, when using a virtual machine (e.g. `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`__), and when downloading videos to a separate filesystem (e.g. an external hard drive), Tartube checks the size of the virtual filesystem instead of the external drive.

This seems to be an issue with the virtualisation software itself (we have confirmed that everything works as expected on a non-virtual system).

The only thing that can be done is to disable the checks and warnings altogether. Click **Edit > System preferences > Files > Device**, and deselect both **Before checking/downloading videos, warn user if disk space is less than** and **Halt downloads if disk space is less than**.

7.35 Cannot embed thumbnails in videos
--------------------------------------

*Q: In download options, I enabled embedding thumbnails in my downloaded videos, but it doesn't work!*

A: Make sure you have installed FFmpeg.

A: Make sure you have not disabled the setting to remove .webp thumbnails after converting them to another format. Open **Edit > System preferences > Operations > Downloads**. If **Convert .webp thumbnails into .jpg thumbnails** is enabled, then **...but don't delete the original thumbnails** should also be enabled.

7.36 Cannot install FFmpeg
--------------------------

*Q: I'm trying to install Tartube on MS Windows. When Tartube prompts me to install FFmpeg, the installation fails!**

A: The software library that makes FFmpeg available for download breaks frequently. The only solution is to wait for the library to be fixed (but please still report the problem to Tartube's authors in the usual way).

This issue only affects users on MS Windows.

7.37 Cannot install yt-dlp plugins
----------------------------------

*Q: I installed a yt-dlp plugin, but it doesn't work, and I can't download even a single video!*

A: Since v2.5.145, Tartube uses a new configuration on MS Windows. (This problem doesn't affect other systems).

If you want to install additional python modules, you must do so in a terminal window inside the virtual environment (venv) that has been set up for you.

There are two ways to do it. The first way is the simplest:

* In Tartube's menu, click **System > Open MSYS2 terminal**

The second way will also work:

* In Tartube's menu, click **System > Show Tartube install folder**
* Navigate to **msys64** folder
* Double-click the **mingw64.exe** application to open it
* In the new terminal window, type the following command before installing anything:

        **source ~/ytdl-venv/bin/activate**

7.38 Annoying messages after downloads
--------------------------------------

*Q: Every time Tartube downloads videos, it shows an annoying dialogue window. Make it stop!*

A: The dialogues can be disabled in **Edit > System preferences > Operations > Actions > Don't notify the user at the end of an operation**.

7.39 No puedo hablar inglés
---------------------------

*Q: ¡No puedo usar Tartube porque no hablo inglés!*

A: Necesitamos más traductores.
