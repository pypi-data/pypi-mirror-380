IT IS NOT PROHIBITED TO COPY AND DISTRIBUTE VERBATIM COPIES OF THIS LICENSE.

PREAMBLE
We maintain that there’s no necessity to alter this license for those who
intend to utilize, augment, or create derivative works from our original
covered work. Consequently, we’ve set forth specific guidelines for the
distribution of any such derivative works. Any distributed improvements or
derivatives must adhere to the same licensing terms as our original work.

We encourage your contributions to our original work, helping you to prevent
dependency on your outdated versions as we anticipate a single primary code
branch, from which all derivatives will emerge. Otherwise, this license also
lets you use our work in “closed-source” projects, or other methods that
safeguard your derivative works, provided you do not distribute a derivative
work as distribution must be exclusively licensed under this license.

This license unifies us against fragmentation, enabling continuous enhancement
while permanently adhering to our original terms. We expect the same from you.
Copyright holders reserve all rights to protect this work and derivative works
covered by this License.

0. Copying, Modification and Distribution
The Covered Work is hereby permanently granted the freedom of copying and
modification to users. And the Covered Work or a Derivative Work may also be
distributed, provided that the entire Source Code of the Covered Work and
Derivative Work is available for all Users to obtain a free copy and
remains subject to this License, without additional restriction. Therefore, all
copies, modifications, and distributions of the Covered Work and or a
Derivative Work must retain the original copyright notice and include an
unaltered copy of this License.

1. Aggregation
In instances where the Covered Work or a Derivative Work is integrated into a
system comprising works governed by various licenses, it is permissible, as an
exception, to aggregate the Covered Work or a Derivative Work on a single
medium. In such cases, the entirety of the aggregated works on the medium does
not need to be subjected to the terms of this License. This exception is
designed to facilitate usability within system(s) encompassing a diverse range
of licensing agreements.

The following disclaimers must keep being prominently displayed in the
