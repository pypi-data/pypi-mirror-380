                   Requirements:
                   - Minimum 512Ã—512px, maximum 16 megapixels, less than 32MB
                   - Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, WebP, HEIC/HEIF
            file_name: The name of the image file including its extension.
                      Requirements:
                      - Supported extensions: .png, .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp, .heic, .heif
