## ðŸ“š Documentation
To learn more about how to use Copyleaks API please check out our [Documentation](https://docs.copyleaks.com/resources/sdks/python/). 

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples
Here are some common usage examples for the Copyleaks SDK. You can also see a comprehensive code example in the `example.py` file on our GitHub repository: [example.py](https://github.com/Copyleaks/Python-Plagiarism-Checker/blob/master/example.py).

### Get Authentication Token
This example demonstrates how to log in to the Copyleaks API and obtain an authentication token.

```python
import base64
from copyleaks.copyleaks import Copyleaks
from copyleaks.exceptions.command_error import CommandError

# --- Your Credentials ---
EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS' # Replace with your Copyleaks registered email
KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'               # Replace with your Copyleaks API Key
# --------------------

# Log in to the Copyleaks API
auth_token = Copyleaks.login(EMAIL_ADDRESS, KEY)
print("âœ… Logged in successfully!")
```
For a detailed understanding of the authentication process, refer to the Copyleaks Login Endpoint [Documentation](https://docs.copyleaks.com/reference/actions/account/login).
##
### Submit Text for Plagiarism Scan
This example shows how to prepare and submit raw text content for a plagiarism scan.

```python
import base64
from copyleaks.copyleaks import Copyleaks
from copyleaks.models.submit.document import FileDocument
from copyleaks.models.submit.properties.scan_properties import ScanProperties

# Prepare your content for scanning
# You can scan a URL, a local file, or raw text.
# This example scans a simple string of text.
print("Submitting text for scanning...")
text_to_scan = "Hello world, this is a test."
base64_content = base64.b64encode(text_to_scan.encode()).decode()

# Configure the scan
scan_id = "my-first-scan" 
scan_properties = ScanProperties("https://your-server.com/webhook/{STATUS}") # IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual webhook URL to receive scan results
scan_properties.set_sandbox(True) # Turn on sandbox mode for testing without consuming credits
file_submission = FileDocument(base64_content, "test.txt")
file_submission.set_properties(scan_properties)

# Submit the scan to Copyleaks
Copyleaks.submit_file(auth_token, scan_id, file_submission)
print(f"ðŸš€ Scan submitted successfully! Scan ID: {scan_id}")
print("You will be notified via your webhook when the scan is complete.")
```

##
### AI-Generated Text Detection
Use the AI detection client to determine if content was generated by artificial intelligence.

```python
import base64
from copyleaks.copyleaks import Copyleaks
from copyleaks.models.submit.document import NaturalLanguageDocument 

scan_id = "your-scan-id"

sample_text = "Lions are social animals, living in groups called prides, typically consisting of several females, their offspring, and a few males. Female lions are the primary hunters, working together to catch prey. Lions are known for their strength, teamwork, and complex social structures."
natural_language_submission = NaturalLanguageDocument(sample_text)
natural_language_submission.set_sandbox(True) # Use sandbox for testing
response = Copyleaks.AiDetectionClient.submit_natural_language(auth_token, scan_id, natural_language_submission)
print("\nAI Detection (Natural Language):")
print(response)
```
For a full guide please refer to our step by step [Guide](https://docs.copyleaks.com/guides/ai-detector/ai-text-detection/)

For a detailed understanding of the Ai detection process, refer to the Copyleaks detect natural language Endpoint [Documentation](https://docs.copyleaks.com/reference/actions/writer-detector/check/)

# Update the path to your image file
image_path = r"PATH TO IMAGE"

with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
    base64_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

payload = CopyleaksAiImageDetectionRequestModel(
    base64=base64_image,
    file_name='my-image.png',
