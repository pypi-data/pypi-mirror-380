def draw_face_coloring(c, pos, external=False, palette=None):
    """
    Draw the face coloring defined by ``c`` and ``pos``

    The RGB color of each face is determined by its color label in ``c`` and
    the chosen palette. If a face is marked as uncolored (i.e., assigned a
    value of ``-1``) it is painted white.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : dict
        A dictionary where keys represent the sequence of nodes occurring
        in each face (polygon), and values represent the face's color.
        Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The first
        element in ``c`` defines the external face of the embedding; the
        remaining elements define the internal faces.

    pos : dict
        A dict specifying the (x,y) coordinates of each node in the embedding.

    external : bool, optional (default=False)
        If set to ``True``, the background (corresponding to the external face
        of the embedding) is also colored, else it is left blank.

    palette : None or dict, optional (default=None)
        A dictionary that maps the integers $-1,0,1,\\ldots$ to RGB values.
        The in-built options are as follows

        * ``gcol.tableau`` : A collection of 21 colors provided by Tableau.
        * ``gcol.colorful`` : A collection of 57 bright colors that are
          chosen to contrast each other as much as possible.
        * ``gcol.colorblind`` : A collection of 11 colors, provided by
          Tableau, that are intended to help colorblind users.
        * If ``None``, then ``gcol.tableau`` is used.

    Given a node coloring ``c`` of a graph ``G``, this method returns the set
    of nodes in the Kempe chain generated from a source node ``s`` using the
    color ``j``.

    A Kempe chain is a connected set of nodes in a graph that alternates
    between two colors [1]_. Equivalently, it is a maximal connected subgraph
    that contains nodes of at most two colors. Interchanging the colors of
    the nodes in a Kempe chain creates a new coloring that uses the same
    number of colors or one fewer color. Two $k$-colorings of a graph are
    considered *Kempe equivalent* if one can be obtained from the other
    through a series of Kempe chain interchanges [2]_. It is also known that,
    if $k$ is larger than the degeneracy of a graph, then all $k$-colorings
    of this graph are Kempe equivalent [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph that we want to compute a Kempe chain for.

    c : dict
        A node coloring of ``G``. Pairs of adjacent nodes cannot be allocated
        to the same color. Any uncolored nodes ``u`` should have ``c[u]==-1``.

    s : node
        The source node that we will generate the Kempe chain from.

    j : int
        The second color to use. The first color is that of ``s``.

    Returns
    -------
    set
        The set of nodes, reachable from ``s``, that alternate between colors
        ``i`` and ``j`` (where ``c[s]==i``).

    Examples
    --------

    Example Kempe chain = {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 17, 18, 19}

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

        If ``G`` contains any self-loops.

    ValueError
        If ``c`` contains a pair of adjacent nodes assigned to the same color.

        If ``c`` contains an invalid color label or no color label for ``s``.

        If ``G`` contains a node that is not in ``c``.

    Notes
    -----
    This method uses an extension of breadth-first search and operates in
    $O(n+m)$ time. If ``c[s]==j``, then the Kempe chain contains node ``s``
    only.

def max_independent_set(G, weight=None, it_limit=0, verbose=0):
    """Attempt to identify the largest independent set of nodes in a graph.

    Here, nodes can also be allocated weights if desired.

    The maximum independent set in a graph $G$ is the largest subset of nodes
    in which none are adjacent. The size of the largest independent in a graph
    $G$ is known as the independence number of $G$ and is often denoted by
    $\\alpha(G)$. Similarly, the maximum-weighted independent set in $G$ is
    the subset of mutually nonadjacent nodes whose weight-total is maximized.

    The problem of determining a maximum(-weighted) independent set of nodes
    is NP-hard. Consequently, this method makes use of a polynomial-time
    heuristic based on local search. It will always return an independent
    set but offers no guarantees on whether this is the optimal solution. The
    algorithm halts once the iteration limit has been reached.

    Note that the similar problem of determining the maximum(-weighted)
    independent set of edges is equivalent to finding a maximum(-weighted)
    matching in a graph. This is a polynomially solvable problem and can be
    solved by the Blossom algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An independent set of nodes in this graph will be returned.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
        If ``None``, every node is assumed to have a weight of ``1``. If a
        string, this should correspond to a defined node attribute. All node
        weights must be positive.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Each iteration has
        a complexity $O(m + n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ is
        the number of edges.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        If set to a positive value, information is output during the
        optimization process. In this output, the cost refers to the number
        of nodes not in the independent set.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list containing the nodes belonging to the independent set.

    >>> print("Independent set =", S)
    Independent set = [0, 1, 3]

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

        If ``G`` contains any self-loops.

    ValueError
        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``verbose`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If a node with a non-positive weight is specified.

    KeyError
        If a node does not have the attribute defined by ``weight``.

    Notes
    -----
    This method uses the PartialCol algorithm for node $k$-coloring using
    $k=1$. The set of nodes assigned to this color corresponds to the
    independent set. PartialCol is based on tabu search. Here, each iteration
    of PartialCol has complexity $O(n + m)$. It also occupies $O(n + m)$ of
    memory space.

    The above algorithm is described in detail in [1]_. The c++ code used in
    [1]_ and [2]_ forms the basis of this library's Python implementations.

          $k$-coloring that minimizes the sum of the weights of the uncolored
          nodes. Clashes are not permitted in a solution. The algorithm halts
          when a zero-cost solution has been determined (this corresponds to a

    Notes
    -----
    If ``weights_at='edges'``, the TabuCol algorithm is used. This algorithm
    is based on tabu search and operates using $k$ colors, allowing clashes
    to occur. The aim is to alter the color assignments so that the number
    of clashes (or the total weight of all clashing edges) is minimized. Each
    iteration of TabuCol has complexity $O(nk + m)$. The process also uses
    $O(nk + m)$ memory.

    If ``weights_at='nodes'``, the PartialCol algorithm is used. This algorithm
    is also based on tabu search and operates using $k$ colors, allowing some
    nodes to be left uncolored. The aim is to make alterations to the color
    assignments so that the number of uncolored nodes (or the total weight of
    the uncolored nodes) is minimized. As with TabuCol, each iteration of
    PartialCol has complexity $O(nk +m)$. This process also uses $O(nk + m)$
    memory.

    This is done so that (a) all adjacent nodes have different colors, and (b)

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The nodes of this graph will be colored.

    k : int
        The number of colors to use.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
        If ``None``, every node is assumed to have a weight of ``1``. If
        string, this should correspond to a defined node attribute. Node
        weights must be positive.

    opt_alg : int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try
        to reduce the number of colors (if this is seen to be greater than
        $k$). It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when the existence of a node $k$-coloring
          has been proved or disproved.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes to have the same color.
          Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is the number
          of nodes in the modified graph, $m$ is the number of edges, and $k$
          is the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes to be uncolored. Each iteration
          has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``4`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) that evolves a small
          population of solutions. During execution, when each new solution is
          created, the local search method used in Option ``2`` above is
          applied for a fixed number of iterations. Each iteration of this HEA
          therefore has a complexity of $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``5`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is applied (as above), using
          the local search method from Option ``3``.
        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

        Further details of these algorithms are given in the notes section of
        the :meth:`node_coloring` method.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Not applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=1``.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        If set to a positive value, information is output during the
        optimization process. The higher the value, the more information.

    -------

        A dictionary with keys representing nodes and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots,k-1$.

        If ``k`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If a clique larger than ``k`` is observed in the graph.

        If a node $k$-coloring could not be determined.

        If a node with a non-positive weight is specified.

    KeyError
        If a node does not have the attribute defined by ``weight``

    Notes
    -----
    This method first follows the same steps as the :meth:`node_k_coloring`
    method to try and find a node $k$-coloring; however, it also takes node
    weights into account if needed. If a node $k$-coloring is achieved, a
    bespoke local search operator (based on steepest descent) is then used to
    try to reduce the standard deviation in weights across the $k$ color
    classes. This process involves evaluating each Kempe-chain interchange in
    the current solution [1]_ and performing the interchange that results in
    the largest reduction in standard deviation. This process repeats until
    there are no interchanges that reduce the standard deviation. Each
    iteration of this local search process takes $O(n^2)$ time. Further details
    on this optimization method can be found in Chapter 7 of [2], or in [3]_.

    All the above algorithms are described in detail in [2]_. The c++ code used
    in [2]_ and [4]_ forms the basis of this library's Python implementations.

    Notes
    -----
    This method begins by coloring the nodes in the order determined by the
    DSatur algorithm [1]_. During this process, each node is assigned to the
    feasible color class $j$ (where $0 \\leq j \\leq k$) with the fewest nodes.
    This encourages an equitable spread of nodes across the $k$ colors. This
    process has a complexity of $O((n \\lg n) + (nk) + (m \\lg m)$. If a node
    $k$-coloring cannot be achieved in this way, further optimization is
    carried out, if desired. These optimization routines are the same as those
    used by the :meth:`node_coloring` method. They also halt immediately once
    a node $k$-coloring has been achieved.

    All the above algorithms are described in detail in [2]_. The c++ code used
    in [2]_ and [3]_ forms the basis of this library's Python implementations.

    Notes
    -----
    As mentioned, in this implementation edge colorings of a graph $G$ are
    determined by forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$ and then following the same
    steps as the :meth:`node_k_coloring` method to try and find a node
    $k$-coloring of $L(G)$; however, it also takes edge weights into account
    if needed. If an edge $k$-coloring is achieved, a bespoke local search
    operator (based on steepest descent) is then used to try to reduce the
    standard deviation in weights across the $k$ color classes. This follows
    the same steps as the :meth:`equitable_node_k_coloring` method, using
    $L(G)$. Further details on this optimization method can be found in Chapter
    7 of [2]_, or in [3]_.

    All the above algorithms are described in detail in [2]_. The c++ code used
    in [2]_ and [4]_ forms the basis of this library's Python implementations.

    This is done so that adjacent edges have different colors (a pair of edges
    is considered adjacent if and only if they share a common endpoint). A set
    of edges assigned to the same color corresponds to a matching; hence the
    equivalent aim is to partition the graph's edges into ``k`` matchings.

    The smallest number of colors needed for coloring the edges of a graph $G$
    is known as the graph's chromatic index, denoted by $\\chi'(G)$.
    Equivalently, $\\chi'(G)$ is the minimum number of matchings needed to
    partition the nodes of a simple graph $G$. According to Vizing's theorem
    [1]_, $\\chi'(G)$ is either $\\Delta(G)$ or $\\Delta(G) + 1$, where
    $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in $G$. The problem of determining an
    edge $k$-coloring is polynomially solvable for any $k > \\Delta(G)$.
    Similarly, it is certain no edge $k$-coloring exists for $k < \\Delta(G)$.
    For $k = \\Delta(G)$, however, the problem is NP-hard.

    This method therefore includes options for using an exact exponential-time
    algorithm (based on backtracking), or a choice of four polynomial-time
    heuristic algorithms (based on local search). The exact algorithm is
    generally only suitable for larger values of $k$, for graphs that are
    small, or graphs that have topologies suited to its search strategies.
    In all other cases, the local search algorithms are more appropriate.

    This method follows the steps used by the :meth:`node_k_coloring` method.
    That is, edge $k$-colorings of a graph $G$ are determined by forming $G$'s
    line graph $L(G)$ and then passing $L(G)$ to the :meth:`node_k_coloring`
    method. All parameters are therefore the same as the latter. (Note that,
    if a graph $G=(V,E)$ has $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, its line graph $L(G)$
    will have $m$ nodes and $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{v\\in V}\\deg(v)^2 - m$ edges.)

    ``ValueError`` exception is raised. Otherwise, an edge $k$-coloring is
    returned.

          same color. Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$
          is the number of nodes in $L(G)$, $m$ is the number of edges in
          $L(G)$, and $k$ is the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes in $L(G)$ to be uncolored. Each
          iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``4`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) that evolves a small
          population of solutions. During execution, when each new solution is
          created, the local search method used in Option ``2`` above is

          the local search method from Option ``3``.
        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Not applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=1``.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        If set to a positive value, information is output during the

    Notes
    -----
    Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, the greedy algorithm
    for node coloring operates in $O(n + m)$ time.

    The ``random`` strategy operates by first randomly permuting the nodes (an
    $O(n)$ operation) before applying the greedy algorithm. It is guaranteed to
    produce a solution with $k \\leq \\Delta(G) + 1$ colors, where
    $\\Delta(G)$ is the highest node degree in the graph $G$.

    The ``welsh-powell`` strategy operates by sorting the nodes by decreasing
    degree (an $O(n \\lg n)$ operation), and then applies the greedy algorithm.
    Its overall complexity is therefore $O(n \\lg n + m)$. Assuming that the
    nodes are labelled $v_1, v_2,\\ldots,v_n$ so that $\\deg(v_1) \\geq
    \\deg(v_2) \\geq \\ldots \\geq \\deg(v_n)$, this method is guaranteed to
    produce a solution with $k \\leq\\max_{i=1,\\ldots,n} \\min(\\deg(v_i)+1,
    i)$ colors. This bound is an improvement on $\\Delta(G) + 1$.

    The ``dsatur`` and ``rlf`` strategies are exact for bipartite, cycle, and
    wheel graphs (that is, solutions with the minimum number of colors are
    guaranteed). The implementation of ``dsatur`` uses a priority queue and has
    a complexity of $O(n \\lg n + m \\lg m)$. The ``rlf`` implementation has a
    complexity of $O(nm)$. In general, the ``rlf`` strategy yields the best
    solutions of the four strategies, though it is computationally more
    expensive. If expense is an issue, then ``dsatur`` is a cheaper alternative
    that also offers high-quality solutions in most cases. See [2]_, [3]_, and
    [4]_ for further information.

    If an optimization algorithm is used, further efforts are made to reduce
    the number of colors. The backtracking approach (``opt_alg=1``) is an
    implementation of the exact algorithm described in [4]_. It has exponential
    runtime and halts only when an optimum solution has been found. At the
    start of execution, a large clique $C\\subseteq V$ is identified using the
    NetworkX function ``max_clique(G)`` and the nodes of $C$ are each assigned
    to a different color. The main backtracking algorithm is then executed and
    only halts only when a solution using $|C|$ colors has been identified, or
    when the algorithm has backtracked to the root of the search tree. In both
    cases the returned solution will be optimal (that is, will be using
    $\\chi(G)$ colors).

    If local search is used (``opt_alg`` is set to ``2``, ``3``, ``4``, or
    ``5``), the algorithm removes a color class and uses the chosen local
    search routine to seek a proper coloring using the remaining colors. This
    process repeats until a solution using $|C|$ colors has been identified
    (as above), or until the iteration limit (defined by ``it_limit``) is
    reached. Fewer colors (but longer run times) occur with larger iteration
    limits.

    If ``opt_alg=2``, the TabuCol algorithm is used. This algorithm is based
    on tabu search and operates by fixing the number of colors but allowing
    clashes to occur (a clash is the occurrence of two adjacent nodes having
    the same color). The aim is to alter the color assignments so that the
    number of clashes is reduced to zero. Each iteration of TabuCol has a
    complexity of $O(nk + m)$, where $k$ is the number of colors currently
    being used. The process also uses $O(nk + m)$ memory.

    If ``opt_alg=3``, the PartialCol algorithm is used. This algorithm is also
    based on tabu search and operates by fixing the number of colors but
    allowing some nodes to be left uncolored. The aim is to make alterations
    to the color assignments so that no uncolored nodes remain. As with
    TabuCol, each iteration of PartialCol has complexity $O(nk +m)$ and uses
    $O(nk + m)$ memory.

    If ``opt_alg`` is set to ``4`` or ``5``, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm
    (HEA) is employed. This method maintains a small population of $k$-colored
    solutions that is evolved using selection, recombination, local search and
    replacement. Specifically, in each HEA cycle, two parent solutions are
    selected from the population, and these are used in conjunction with a
    specialised recombination operator to produce a new offspring solution.
    Local search is this applied to the offspring for a fixed number of
    iterations, and the resultant solution is inserted back into the
    population, replacing its weaker parent. If ``opt_alg=4``, TabuCol is
    used as the local search operator; if ``opt_alg=5``, PartialCol is used.
    Each iteration of the HEA has complexity $O(nk+m)$, as above. Note that
    the HEA is often able to produce solutions using fewer colors compared to
    when using ``opt_alg=2`` or ``opt_alg=3``; however, larger iteration
    limits will usually be needed to see these improvements.

    As stated above, if ``verbose`` is set to a positive integer, output is

def edge_coloring(G, strategy="dsatur", opt_alg=None, it_limit=0, verbose=0):
    """Return a coloring of a graph's edges.

    An edge coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to edges so that
    adjacent edges have different colors (a pair of edges is considered
    adjacent if and only if they share a common endpoint). The aim is to use
    as few colors as possible. A set of edges assigned to the same color
    corresponds to a matching; hence the equivalent aim is to partition the
    graph's edges into a minimum number of matchings.

    The smallest number of colors needed for coloring the edges of a graph $G$
    is known as the graph's chromatic index, denoted by $\\chi'(G)$.
    Equivalently, $\\chi'(G)$ is the minimum number of matchings needed to
    partition the nodes of a simple graph $G$. According to Vizing's theorem
    [1]_, $\\chi'(G)$ is either $\\Delta(G)$ or $\\Delta(G) + 1$, where
    $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree in $G$.

    Determining an edge coloring that minimizes the number of colors is an
    NP-hard problem. This method therefore includes options for using an
    exponential-time exact algorithm (based on backtracking), or a choice of
    four polynomial-time heuristic algorithms (based on local search). The
    exact algorithm is generally only suitable for graphs that are small,
    or that have topologies suited to its search strategies. In all other
    cases, the local search algorithms are more appropriate.

    In this implementation, edge colorings of a graph $G$ are determined by
    forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$, and then passing $L(G)$ to the
    :meth:`node_coloring` method. All parameters are therefore the same as the
    latter. (Note that, if a graph $G=(V,E)$ has $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, its
    line graph $L(G)$ will have $m$ nodes and $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{v\\in V}
    \\deg(v)^2 - m$ edges.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The edges of this graph will be colored.

    strategy : string, optional (default='dsatur')
        A string specifying the method used to generate the initial solution.
        It must be one of the following:

        * ``'random'`` : Randomly orders $L(G)$'s nodes and then applies the
          greedy algorithm for graph node coloring [2]_.
        * ``'welsh-powell'`` : Orders $L(G)$'s nodes by decreasing degree,
          then applies the greedy algorithm.
        * ``'dsatur'`` : Uses the DSatur algorithm for graph node coloring
          on $L(G)$ [3]_.
        * ``'rlf'`` : Uses the recursive largest first (RLF) algorithm for
          graph node coloring on $L(G)$ [4]_.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try
        to reduce the number of colors. It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes in $L(G)$ to have the
          same color. Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$
          is the number of nodes in $L(G)$, $m$ is the number of edges in
          $L(G)$, and $k$ is the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes in $L(G)$ to be uncolored. Each
          iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``4`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) that evolves a small
          population of solutions. During execution, when each new solution is
          created, the local search method used in Option ``2`` above is
          applied for a fixed number of iterations. Each iteration of this HEA
          therefore has a complexity of $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``5`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is applied (as above), using
          the local search method from Option ``3``.
        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

        Further details of these algorithms are given in the notes section of
        the :meth:`node_coloring` method.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Not applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=1``.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        If set to a positive value, information is output during the
        optimization process. The higher the value, the more information.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing edges and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The
        number of colors being used in a solution ``c`` is therefore
        ``max(c.values()) + 1``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> import gcol
    >>>
    >>> G = nx.dodecahedral_graph()
    >>> c = gcol.edge_coloring(G)
    >>> print("Coloring is", c)
    Coloring is {(11, 12): 0, (11, 18): 1, ..., (7, 8): 0}
    >>>
    >>> print("Number of colors =", max(c.values()) + 1)
    Number of colors = 3
    >>>
    >>> c = gcol.edge_coloring(G, strategy="rlf", opt_alg=2, it_limit=1000)
    >>> print("Coloring is", c)
    Coloring is {(3, 4): 0, (17, 18): 0, ..., (7, 14): 2}
    >>>
    >>> print("Number of colors =", max(c.values()) + 1)
    Number of colors = 3

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

        If ``G`` contains any self-loops.

    ValueError
        If ``strategy`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``opt_alg`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``verbose`` is not a nonnegative integer.

    Notes
    -----
    As mentioned, in this implementation, edge colorings of a graph $G$ are
    determined by forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$ and then passing $L(G)$ to
    the :meth:`node_coloring` method. All details are therefore the same as
    those in the latter, where they are documented more fully.

    All the above algorithms and bounds are described in detail in [5]_. The
    c++ code used in [5]_ and [6]_ forms the basis of this library's Python
    implementations.

    A node coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to nodes so that
    adjacent nodes have different colors. The aim is to use as few colors as
    possible. A set of nodes assigned to the same color corresponds to an
    independent set; hence the equivalent aim is to partition the graph's

    In the node precoloring problem, some of the nodes have already been
    assigned colors. The aim is to allocate colors to the remaining nodes so
    that we get a full, proper node coloring that uses a minimum number of
    colors. The node precoloring problem can be used to model the Latin square
    completion problem and Sudoku puzzles [1]_.

    The node precoloring problem is NP-hard. This method therefore includes

    In this implementation, solutions are found by taking all nodes
    pre-allocated to the same color $j$ and merging them into a single
    super-node. Edges are then added between all pairs of super-nodes,
    and the modified graph is passed to the :meth:`node_coloring` method. All
    parameters are therefore the same as the latter. This modification process
    is described in more detail in Chapter 6 of [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The nodes of this graph will be colored.

    precol : None or dict, optional (default=None)
        A dictionary that specifies the (integer) colors of any precolored

    strategy : string, optional (default='dsatur')
        A string specifying the method used to generate the initial solution.
        It must be one of the following:

        * ``'random'`` : Randomly orders the modified graph's nodes and then
          applies the greedy algorithm for graph node coloring [2]_.
        * ``'welsh-powell'`` : Orders the modified graphs nodes by decreasing
          degree, then applies the greedy algorithm.
        * ``'dsatur'`` : Uses the DSatur algorithm for graph node coloring on
          the modified graph [3]_.
        * ``'rlf'`` : Uses the recursive largest first (RLF) algorithm for
          graph node coloring on the modified graph [4]_.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to
        try to reduce the number of colors. It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes to have the same color.
          Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is the number
          of nodes in the modified graph, $m$ is the number of edges, and $k$
          is the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes to be uncolored. Each iteration
          has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``4`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) that evolves a small
          population of solutions. During execution, when each new solution is
          created, the local search method used in Option ``2`` above is
          applied for a fixed number of iterations. Each iteration of this HEA

          the local search method from Option ``3``.
        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

        Further details of these algorithms are given in the notes section of
        the :meth:`node_coloring` method.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Not applicable

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        If set to a positive value, information is output during the

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing nodes and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The

    -----
    As mentioned, in this implementation, solutions are formed by passing a
    modified version of the graph to :meth:`node_coloring` method. All details
    are therefore the same as those in the latter, where they are documented.

    All the above algorithms and bounds are described in detail in [1]. The c++
    code used in [1]_ and [5]_ forms the basis of this library's Python
    implementations.

def edge_precoloring(
    G, precol=None, strategy="dsatur", opt_alg=None, it_limit=0, verbose=0
):
    """Return a coloring of a graph's edges where some edges are precolored.

    An edge coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to edges so that
    adjacent edges have different colors (a pair of edges is considered
    adjacent if and only if they share a common endpoint). The aim is to use
    as few colors as possible. A set of edges assigned to the same color
    corresponds to a matching; hence the equivalent aim is to partition the
    graph's edges into a minimum number of matchings.

    In the edge precoloring problem, some of the edges have already been
    assigned colors. The aim is to allocate colors to the remaining edges so
    that we get a full edge coloring that uses a minimum number of colors.

    The edge precoloring problem is NP-hard. This method therefore includes
    options for using an exponential-time exact algorithm (based on
    backtracking), or a choice of four polynomial-time heuristic algorithms
    (based on local search). The exact algorithm is generally only suitable
    for graphs that are small, or that have topologies suited to its search
    strategies. In all other cases, the local search algorithms are more
    appropriate.

    In this implementation, edge colorings of a graph $G$ are determined by
    forming $G$'s line graph $L(G)$ and then passing $L(G)$ to the
    :meth:`node_precoloring` method. All parameters are therefore the same as
    the latter. (Note that, if a graph $G=(V,E)$ has $n$ nodes and $m$ edges,
    its line graph $L(G)$ will have $m$ nodes and $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{v\\in V}
    \\deg(v)^2 - m$ edges.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The edges of this graph will be colored.

    precol : None or dict, optional (default=None)
        A dictionary that specifies the colors of any precolored edges.

    strategy : string, optional (default='dsatur')
        A string specifying the method used to generate the initial solution.
        It must be one of the following:

        * ``'random'`` : Randomly orders $L(G)$'s nodes and then applies the
          greedy algorithm for graph node coloring [1]_.
        * ``'welsh-powell'`` : Orders $L(G)$'s nodes by decreasing degree,
          then applies the greedy algorithm.
        * ``'dsatur'`` : Uses the DSatur algorithm for graph node coloring on
          $L(G)$ [2]_.
        * ``'rlf'`` : Uses the recursive largest first (RLF) algorithm for
          graph node coloring on $L(G)$ [3]_.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try
        to reduce the number of colors. It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes in $L(G)$ to have the
          same color. Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is
          the number of nodes in $L(G)$, $m$ is the number of edges, and $k$ is
          the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes in $L(G)$ to be uncolored. Each
          iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``4`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) that evolves a small
          population of solutions. During execution, when each new solution is
          created, the local search method used in Option ``2`` above is
          applied for a fixed number of iterations. Each iteration of this HEA
          therefore has a complexity of $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``5`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is applied (as above), using
          the local search method from Option ``3``.
        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

        Further details of these algorithms are given in the notes section of
        the :meth:`node_coloring` method.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Not applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=1``.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        If set to a positive value, information is output during the
        optimization process. The higher the value, the more information.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing edges and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The
        number of colors being used in a solution ``c`` is therefore
        ``max(c.values()) + 1``. If ``precol[(u,v)]==j`` then ``c[(u,v)]==j``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> import gcol
    >>>
    >>> G = nx.dodecahedral_graph()
    >>> p = {(0, 1):0, (8, 9): 1, (10, 11): 2, (11, 12): 3}
    >>> c = gcol.edge_precoloring(G, precol=p)
    >>> print("Coloring is",c)
    Coloring is {(0, 1): 0, (8, 9): 1, ..., (5, 6): 2}
    >>>
    >>> print("Number of colors =", max(c.values()) + 1)
    Number of colors = 4

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

        If ``G`` contains any self-loops.

    ValueError
        If ``strategy`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``opt_alg`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``verbose`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``precol`` contains an edge that is not in ``G``.

        If ``precol`` contains a non-integer color label.

        If ``precol`` contains a pair of adjacent edges assigned to the same
        color.

        If ``precol`` uses an integer color label $j$, but there exists a color
        label $0 \\leq i < j$ that is not being used.

    A face coloring is an assignment of colors to the faces of a graph's planar
    embedding so that adjacent faces have different colors (a pair of faces is
    adjacent if and only if they share a bordering edge). The aim is to use as
    few colors as possible. Face colorings are only possible in planar
    embeddings; hence the graph ``G`` must be planar, and ``pos`` should give
    valid $(x,y)$ coordinates for all nodes.

    The smallest number of colors needed to face color a graph is known as its
    face chromatic number. According to the four color theorem [1]_, face
    colorings never require more than four colors. In this implementation, face
    colorings of a graph $G$ are determined by forming $G$'s dual graph, and
    then coloring the dual's nodes using the :meth:`node_coloring` method. All

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes in the dual to have the
          same color. Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is
          the number of nodes in the dual, $m$ is the number of edges in the
          dual, and $k$ is the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes in the dual to be uncolored.
          Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.

        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

        Further details of these algorithms are given in the notes section of

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Not applicable

        A dictionary with keys representing faces and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The

        of arcs that surround it in a counterclockwise direction. Similarly,
        the one external face is identified by the series of arcs traveling in
        a clockwise direction. Including one of these surrounding arcs in the
        precoloring is sufficient.

    strategy : string, optional (default='dsatur')
        A string specifying the method used to generate the initial solution.
        It must be one of the following:

        * ``'random'`` : Randomly orders the dual's nodes and then applies the
          greedy algorithm for graph node coloring [1]_.
        * ``'welsh-powell'`` : Orders the dual's nodes by decreasing degree,
          then applies the greedy algorithm.
        * ``'dsatur'`` : Uses the DSatur algorithm for graph node coloring on
          the dual [2]_.
        * ``'rlf'`` : Uses the recursive largest first (RLF) algorithm for
          graph node coloring on the dual [3]_.

    opt_alg : None or int, optional (default=None)
        An integer specifying the optimization method that will be used to try
        to reduce the number of colors. It must be one of the following

        * ``1`` : An exact, exponential-time algorithm based on backtracking.
          The algorithm halts only when an optimal solution has been found.
        * ``2`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing adjacent nodes in the dual to have the
          same color. Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, where $n$ is
          the number of nodes in the dual, $m$ is the number of edges in the
          dual, and $k$ is the number of colors in the current solution.
        * ``3`` : A local search algorithm that seeks to reduce the number of
          colors by temporarily allowing nodes in the dual to be uncolored.
          Each iteration has a complexity $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``4`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) that evolves a small
          population of solutions. During execution, when each new solution is
          created, the local search method used in Option ``2`` above is
          applied for a fixed number of iterations. Each iteration of this HEA
          therefore has a complexity of $O(m + kn)$, as above.
        * ``5`` : A hybrid evolutionary algorithm is applied (as above), using
          the local search method from Option ``3``.
        * ``None`` : No optimization is performed.

        Further details of these algorithms are given in the notes section of
        the :meth:`node_coloring` method.

    it_limit : int, optional (default=0)
        Number of iterations of the local search procedure. Not applicable
        when using ``opt_alg=1``.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        If set to a positive value, information is output during the
        optimization process. The higher the value, the more information.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary with keys representing faces and values representing their
        colors. Colors are identified by the integers $0,1,2,\\ldots$. The
        number of colors being used in a solution ``c`` is therefore
        ``max(c.values()) + 1``. Each face (key) is a tuple that gives the
        sequence of nodes that surround it. These correspond to cycles in
        ``G``. The first element in ``c`` defines the external face; the
        remainder defines the internal faces. For internal faces, the nodes
        are listed in a counterclockwise order; for the external face, the
        nodes are listed in a clockwise order.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import gcol
    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>>
    >>> G = nx.dodecahedral_graph()
    >>> pos = nx.planar_layout(G)
    >>> P = {(14,15): 0, (15,14): 1, (1,2): 0}
    >>> c = gcol.face_precoloring(G, pos, P)
    >>> print(c)
    {(1, 0, 10, 9, 8): 1, (10, 0, 19, 18, 11): 2, ..., (13, 12, 16, 15, 14): 1}

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If ``G`` is a directed graph or a multigraph.

        If ``G`` contains any self-loops.

    TypeError
        If ``pos`` is not a dictionary.

    ValueError
        If ``strategy`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``opt_alg`` is not among the supported options.

        If ``it_limit`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``verbose`` is not a nonnegative integer.

        If ``precol`` contains an arc that is not in the embedding of ``G``.

        If ``precol`` contains a non-integer color label.

        If ``precol`` contains a pair of adjacent faces assigned to the same
        color.

        If ``precol`` uses an integer color label $j$, but there exists a color
        label $0 \\leq i < j$ that is not being used.

        If ``pos`` has missing or invalid entries.

        If ``pos`` does not specify a valid planar embedding of ``G``.

        If ``G`` is not planar or contains bridges.

    Notes
    -----
    As mentioned, in this implementation face colorings of a graph $G$ are
    determined by forming its dual and then passing this to the
    :meth:`node_precoloring` method. All details are therefore the same as
    those in the latter method, where they are documented more fully.

    All the above algorithms and bounds are described in detail in [4]_. The
    c++ code used in [4]_ and [5]_ forms the basis of this library's Python
    implementations.
