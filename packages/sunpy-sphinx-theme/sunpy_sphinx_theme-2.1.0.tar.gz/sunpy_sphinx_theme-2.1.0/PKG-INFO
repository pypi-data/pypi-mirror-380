# SunPy Project Sphinx Theme

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sunpy-sphinx-theme.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sunpy-sphinx-theme)

This repository contains the sphinx theme used by The Sunpy Project for all online resources.

This theme is a derivative of the excellent [pydata-sphinx-theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), customized to present a uniform navigation over all the projects.

For more information see the [documentation](https://docs.sunpy.org/projects/sunpy-sphinx-theme/latest/).
