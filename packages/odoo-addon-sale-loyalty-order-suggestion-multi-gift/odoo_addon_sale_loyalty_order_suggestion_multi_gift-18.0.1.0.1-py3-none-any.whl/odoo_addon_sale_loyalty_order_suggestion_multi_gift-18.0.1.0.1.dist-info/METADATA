Usage
=====

To use this module:

- Configure or create a promotion and set in its rules a minimum
  quantity of products required.
- Create a sales order and add one of the products that were part of the
  rewards to the order lines. This line will be marked with an icon (üéÅ)
  that will appear at the bottom right.
- Click on the icon and the wizard will open with the available
  promotions.
- Select the promotion and the products needed to apply it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

For the moment only suggestions for promotions whose multi-gift rewards
include products added to the sales order and whose rules have
product-based criteria will be taken into account. This module could be
extended to take into account other types of rules in the loyalty
programs to be able to apply the promotion from the wizard.
