Pipeline management for LLM to SLM conversion.

This module provides the core pipeline functionality for converting Large Language Models (LLMs)
to Small Language Models (SLMs). It handles the end-to-end process including model loading,
processing, and export, designed for production deployment with robust error handling and logging.
