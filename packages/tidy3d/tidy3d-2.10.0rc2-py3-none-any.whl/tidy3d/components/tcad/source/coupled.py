    Notes
    -----

        If a :class:`HeatFromElectricSource` is specified as a source, appropriate boundary
        conditions for an electric simulation must be provided, since such a simulation
        will be executed before the heat simulation can run.

    Example
    -------
    >>> heat_source = HeatFromElectricSource()
