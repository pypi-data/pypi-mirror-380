MapProxy is an open source proxy for geospatial data. It caches, accelerates and transforms data from existing map services and serves any desktop or web GIS client.

MapProxy is a tile cache, but also offers many new and innovative features like full support for WMS clients.

MapProxy is released under the Apache Software License 2.0, runs on Unix/Linux and Windows and is easy to install and to configure.

Changes
-------
5.1.0 2025-09-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

  - Added `query_layers` option to `wms_opts` to be able to configure the `QUERY_LAYERS` of the wms request
  - Added workflow to republish docker images if the base image changed, i.e. for security updates

Maintenance:

  - Fixed some spelling and debug output
  - Updated various dependencies

Fixes:

  - Fixes some errors in the json schema regarding `use_direct_level_from` and `use_direct_res_from`
  - Fixes an error with merging resolutions of grids


5.0.0 2025-06-18
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Breaking:

  - The dependencies lxml, shapely, pyproj, gdal and PyYAML are no longer optional

Maintenance:

  - By default lxml, shapely, pyproj, Pillow and PyYAML are now installed via pip and are not recommended to be installed
    as apt packages anymore

Fixes:

  - The alpine image uses the python3 plugin for uwsgi correctly
  - An lxml encoding error is fixed


4.1.2 2025-05-27
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maintenance:

    - Set Pillow versions in setup.py to actually supported versions
    - Using PIL instead of Pillow was not working since Python 2, so it is removed from setup.py
    - Using a higher pyproj version for Python 3.13 is necessary
    - Added a test for an older Pillow version with Python 3.9


4.1.1 2025-04-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

  - The scale denominator in the WMTS capabilites is now rounded to 10 digits after the decimal place.


4.1.0 2025-04-29
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

  - It is now possible to integrate the grid name into paths for AWS buckets. This allows storage of tiles for multiple
    grids in the same bucket.
  - We are returning a 404 http status code instead of a 500 if no legend graphic is found for a service.
  - We are using utf-8 in GetFeatureInfo requests now.

Maintenance:

  - Updated some dependencies.
  - Updated the GitHub runner versions.
  - Refactored the grid.py file into multiple files.
  - Removed the implementation of odict in favour of the builtin OrderedDict class.
  - Added support for python 3.13.
  - Skipping permissions tests if tests are run with root user. This is necessary to build and test MapProxy in a chroot
    environment which is used to package MapProxy for Debian. Normal testing is not affected.

Fixes:

  - Fixed deprecation warnings for utctime, sqlite, ImageMath.eval, mock_s3.
  - Fix entrypoint.sh to create default MapProxy configurations if none are found.
  - Allowed the trivy security scan workflow to write the results to the GitHub security tab.
  - We are not allowing the deprecated TLS Versions 1.1 or lower for connections to servers anymore.


4.0.2 2025-04-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixes:

- Security fix to prevent XSS injections in demo pages
- Security fix to prevent reading file urls


4.0.1 2025-03-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Improvements:

  - Added docs regarding OGC API support

Fixes:

  - WMTS Demo now works if kvp is disabled
