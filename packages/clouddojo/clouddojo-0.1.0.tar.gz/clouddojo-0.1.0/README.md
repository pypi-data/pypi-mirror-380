## 🌟 What is CloudDojo?
CloudDojo is your gamified dojo where you learn DevOps troubleshooting through stories, sweat, and a dash of *anime spirit*. It’s like leveling up in your favorite RPG — but instead of dragons, you fight container demons.

- **🎮 Story-driven scenarios** — Real company drama, but without the annoying meetings
- **🛤️ Structured learning paths** — Beginner → Intermediate → Pro-level boss fights
- **💡 Progressive hints** — Because nobody likes spoilers, but everyone loves a helping hand
- **🏆 Achievement system** — XP, levels, badges — basically, bragging rights
- **📊 Progress tracking** — Watch your DevOps powers grow like a true shonen hero

## 🎓 Learning Paths

| Path | Level | Focus | Scenarios |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 🐋 **Container Fundamentals** | Beginner | Docker, nginx, configs | 3 |
| ⚓ **Kubernetes Warrior** | Intermediate | Pods, services, networking | 3 |
| 🔥 **Production SRE** | Advanced | System admin, automation | 2 |



## 🎯 What You'll Learn

**Docker troubleshooting** — When containers act like rebellious teenagers

**Kubernetes debugging** — Because clusters love throwing tantrums

**Production scenarios** — Real-world chaos without the screaming bosses (hopefully)        

**Best practices** — The ancient scrolls of DevOps wisdom, passed down so you don’t mess up

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Contributions Welcome!
AI sidekicks like ChatGPT or Copilot are totally legit — just use our AI PR Template so we know you didn’t summon a demon instead.

## 📚 Documentation Scrolls
**CONTRIBUTING.md** — How to add epic scenarios

**ARCHITECTURE.md** — The bones of CloudDojo

**TESTING.md** — How to make sure your code doesn’t explode

**SECURITY.md** — Because safety first, ninja style

## 📋 Prerequisites (Your gear before the battle)
**Python 3.8+**

**Docker** (auto-installed by setup, if you don’t want to wait forever)

**kubectl** (also auto-installed, for your convenience)

**NOTE:**
Auto-install might take a while (because patience is a virtue nobody asked for). We highly recommend installing Docker, Kubernetes, and Minikube yourself first — then run the auto-setup to verify everything didn’t self-destruct.

We’re *“working hard”* on the setup script… but if you want to help, contributions are welcome. No pressure. Seriously.
