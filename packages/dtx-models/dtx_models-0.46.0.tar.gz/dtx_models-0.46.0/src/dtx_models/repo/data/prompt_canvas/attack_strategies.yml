# Attack Strategy Definitions Library (Updated Structure)
#
# This file contains a consolidated list of attack strategy configurations that 
# can be loaded by the system. Each entry is a blueprint for an attack strategy.
# Complex structured parameters are now direct fields of the strategy.
# Objective targets use placeholders, adversarial targets use openai/gpt-4o.
