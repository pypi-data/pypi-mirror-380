2. Why this requirement is important for software engineering best practices
3. Exactly what the AI assistant needs to do to fix it

Guidelines for your response:
- Be direct, helpful, and specific
- Use a professional but encouraging tone
- Focus on actionable steps the AI assistant can take
- Explain the reasoning behind requirements when helpful
