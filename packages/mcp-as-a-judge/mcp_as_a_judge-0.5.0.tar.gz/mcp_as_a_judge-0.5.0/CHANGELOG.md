## [1.0.0](https://github.com/OtherVibes/mcp-as-a-judge/compare/v0.1.8...v1.0.0) (2025-08-30)

### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

* judge_coding_plan now requires research_urls parameter

Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Forces AI assistants to do actual online research
- ‚úÖ Validates research quality through URL evidence
- ‚úÖ Ensures investigation of existing solutions and best practices
- ‚úÖ Improves implementation approach validation
- ‚úÖ All tests updated and passing (41/41)

* feat: mandate online research with URL validation and backward compatibility

- Make online research MANDATORY in docstring and prompts
- AI assistants MUST perform online research and provide URLs
- research_urls parameter optional for backward compatibility but strongly enforced
- Enhanced prompts to REJECT submissions without research URLs
- Clear instruction that online research is not optional
- URLs should be comma-separated list demonstrating actual research
- Prioritize existing solutions: current repo > well-known libraries > in-house

Key changes:
- ‚úÖ MANDATORY online research requirement in all documentation
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible research_urls parameter (optional with empty default)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced validation to reject missing URLs as research failure
- ‚úÖ Clear guidance that online research is required, not optional
- ‚úÖ Instructs AI to actually DO research, not just ask for URLs
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (41/41)

Fixes validation error while maintaining mandatory research requirement.

* feat: enforce mandatory online research with List[str] URLs and collaborative workflow

- Add mandatory minimum 3 URLs validation for research_urls parameter
- Change research_urls from str to List[str] for proper URL handling
- Add validation that rejects submissions with insufficient research URLs
- Update docstring to emphasize collaborative workflow with user
- Clarify that AI must 'collaborate with the user' and 'perform ONLINE research'
- Restructure workflow order: requirements ‚Üí online research ‚Üí repo analysis ‚Üí design ‚Üí plan
- Enhanced prompts to properly format URL lists with Jinja templating
- All tests updated to provide minimum 3 URLs and use List[str] format

Breaking changes:
- research_urls parameter now requires List[str] instead of str
- Minimum 3 URLs required (validates and rejects if insufficient)
- Function signature maintains backward compatibility with None default

Benefits:
- ‚úÖ Forces actual online research with evidence (minimum 3 URLs)
- ‚úÖ Prevents AI from working unilaterally - requires collaboration
- ‚úÖ Proper data structure for URL handling (List[str])
- ‚úÖ Clear workflow prioritizing existing solutions over custom development
- ‚úÖ All tests passing with proper URL validation (41/41)
