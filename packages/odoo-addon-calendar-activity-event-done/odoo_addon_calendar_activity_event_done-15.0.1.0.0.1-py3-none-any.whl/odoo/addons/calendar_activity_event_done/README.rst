This module allows you to see, at the beginning of a calendar event's
displayed name, if the activity that generated it has been marked as
done.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a calendar event from an activity. For example, with the CRM
   module, go to "CRM", and create an oportunity. Then, in the chatter,
   create a "Call" activity, with the "Open Calendar" button, and then
   create a calendar event linked with the activity. 1.1 Go to "CRM",
   and create an oportunity. 1.2 In the chatter of the opportunity form
   view, create an activity, select the 'call' activity type (for
   example). 1.3 In the activity creation form, click the "Open
   Calendar" button, and then create a calendar event that will be
   linked with your new activity.

2. Mark the created activity as done. Then, go to calendar and see that
   the meeting has been marked as done with the following emoji: ✅

Note: If you cancel the activity, instead om marking it as done, the
calendar event is removed. This is Odoo's default behaviour
