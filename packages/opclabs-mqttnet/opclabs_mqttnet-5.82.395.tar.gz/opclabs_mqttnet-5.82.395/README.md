OpcLabs.MqttNet (NuGet) / opclabs_mqttnet (Python)
==================================================

The OpcLabs.MqttNet (NuGet) or opclabs_mqttnet (Python) package provides MQTT 
communication features for the OPC Labs products, building on MQTTnet and 
MQTTnet.Extensions.ManagedClient libraries by Christian Kratky.Its current 
use is with the OpcLabs.QuickOpc / opclabs_quickopc package for OPC UA PubSub 
transport protocol mappings based on MQTT.

In most cases, this package is recommended over the OpcLabs.Mqtt / 
opclabs_mqtt package which is based on a different library and has less
features.
