============
Protocol API
============

Dart Sass provides entrypoint of `The Embedded Sass Protocol`_.
Currently, this project supports low-level protocol access.

.. _The Embedded Sass Protocol: https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/main/spec/embedded-protocol.md

.. note::

   **Under construction**

   This API will be implemented to work correctly,
   but it is only to send and recieve protobuf message.

   If you want to know usage now, See `example code`_.
