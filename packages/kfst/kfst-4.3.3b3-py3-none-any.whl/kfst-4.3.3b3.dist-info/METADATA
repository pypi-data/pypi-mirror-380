# KFST

KFST is a finite state transducer library written in pure Python. It supports reading transducers from [AT&T tabular format](https://github.com/hfst/hfst/blob/master/doc/transducer-representations-formats.rst) files and its own binary format.
In addition to standard features, it also supports flag diacritics.

The intended use case is to use KFST in environments in which native libraries like HFST cannot be installed.

## Installation

KFST is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

```
pip install kfst
```

## Usage

In this example, we assume that you have a transducer stored in the file `my-transducer.att`.
You can easily create such file using the HFST toolkit:

```sh
hfst-fst2txt -f att my-transducer.hfst > my-transducer.att

# if you want a kfst file:
python -m kfst.convert my-transducer.att my-transducer.kfst
```

### Reading transducers

Transducers can be read from AT&T tabular format files using the `read_att_file` function, and the KFST binary format using the `read_kfst_file` function:

```python
from kfst import FST

fst = FST.read_att_file("my-transducer.att")
# or
fst = FST.read_kfst_file("my-transducer.kfst")
```

### Using the transducer

To run the transducer, use the `lookup` method, which returns a list of tuples of the form `(output, weight)` sorted by weight:

```python
fst.lookup("foo")
```
