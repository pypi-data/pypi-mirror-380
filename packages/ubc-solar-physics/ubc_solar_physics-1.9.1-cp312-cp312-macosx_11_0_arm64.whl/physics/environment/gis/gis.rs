/// Generate valid driving speeds as a simulation-time array given a set of average speeds for each
/// simulated lap.
/// Driving speeds will only be non-zero when we are allowed to drive, and the speed
/// for every tick during a lap will be that lap's corresponding desired average speed for as long
/// as it takes to complete the lap.
/// An average speed of 0m/s for a lap will be interpreted as "sit and charge" for `idle_time`
/// ticks.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `average_speeds`: An array of average speeds in m/s, one for each simulated lap. If there are more
/// speeds given than laps available, the unused speeds will be silently ignored. If there are too
/// few, an error will be returned.
/// * `simulation_dt`: The simulated tick length
/// * `driving_allowed_boolean`: A simulation-time boolean where the `True` elements are when we
/// are allowed to drive, and `False` is when we are not.
/// * `track_length`: The length of the track in meters.
/// * `idle_time`: The number of ticks to "sit and charge" when desired.
///
/// Returns: A simulation-time array of driving speeds in m/s, or an error if there weren't enough
/// laps provided to fill the entire simulation time.
