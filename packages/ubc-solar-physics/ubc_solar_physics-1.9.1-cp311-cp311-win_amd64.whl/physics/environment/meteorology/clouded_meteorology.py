        IMPORTANT: we only have weather coordinates for a discrete set of coordinates. However, the car could be at any
        coordinate in between these available weather coordinates. We need to figure out what coordinate the car is at
        at each timestep and then we can figure out the full weather forecast at each timestep.

        For example, imagine the car is at some coordinate (10, 20). Further imagine that we have a week's worth of
        weather forecasts for the following five coordinates: (5, 4), (11, 19), (20, 30), (40, 30), (0, 60). Which
        set of weather forecasts should we choose? Well, we should choose the (11, 19) one since our coordinate
        (10, 20) is closest to (11, 19). This is what the following code is accomplishing. However, it is not dealing
        with the coordinates directly but rather is dealing with the distances between the coordinates.

        Furthermore, once we have chosen a week's worth of weather forecasts for a specific coordinate, we must isolate
        a single weather forecast depending on what time the car is at the coordinate (10, 20). That is the job of the
        `get_weather_forecast_in_time()` method.

        # This characterizes the weather at every point along the FSGP tracks

        # reasonable assumption to make for FSGP only.

        Takes in an array of indices of the weather_forecast array, and an array of timestamps. Uses those to figure out
        what the weather forecast is at each time step being simulated.

        we only have weather at discrete timestamps. The car however can be in any timestamp in
        between. Therefore, we must be able to choose the weather timestamp that is closest to the one that the car is in
        so that we can more accurately determine the weather experienced by the car at that timestamp.

        For example, imagine the car is at some coordinate (x,y) at timestamp 100. Imagine we know the weather forecast
        at (x,y) for five different timestamps: 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120. Which weather forecast should we
        choose? Clearly, we should choose the weather forecast at 90 since it is the closest to 100. That's what the
