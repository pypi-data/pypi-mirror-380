        Takes in an array of indices of the weather_forecast array, and an array of timestamps. Uses those to figure out
        what the weather forecast is at each time step being simulated.

        we only have weather at discrete timestamps. The car however can be in any timestamp in
        between. Therefore, we must be able to choose the weather timestamp that is closest to the one that the car is in
        so that we can more accurately determine the weather experienced by the car at that timestamp.

        For example, imagine the car is at some coordinate (x,y) at timestamp 100. Imagine we know the weather forecast
        at (x,y) for five different timestamps: 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120. Which weather forecast should we
        choose? Clearly, we should choose the weather forecast at 90 since it is the closest to 100. That's what the
        below code is accomplishing.
