## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability, please report it as soon as possible

developer using one of our Slack spaces.

**Do not** report the issue on GitHub for confidentiality reasons.

Vulnerabilities will be accepted and acted on based on an assessment of their

and explain our assessment and related action.
