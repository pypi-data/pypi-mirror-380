ThAr_HARPS_lines.dat
     The APF uses the same lamps as the HARPS spectrometer
     by construction. Most lines come from Lovis and Pepe (2007)
     which provides wavelengthsf for the lines detected by the 
     spectrometer.
     The HARPS spectrometer has a gap of ~25 A between 5305 and 
     5330 which is filled in with a theory paper, RNS14. This uses
     Lovis and Pepe (2007) to calibrate the Th atom model and predict
     the position of additional lines not covered by HARPS.
