## Features

- [x] Search Ahmia.fi from the command line
- [x] Export results to CSV
- [x] Enable/Disable routing requests through Tor
- [x] Return results in a clean readable format

## Installation

**PyAhmia** is available on PyPI and can be installed like so:

```commandline
pip install pyahmia
```

This will install `ahmia` and `pyahmia` as commands.

## Usage

To start searching, you can call `ahmia` (or `pyahmia`) with the specified search query.

*example*:

```commandline
ahmia QUERY
```

### Routing Traffic Through Tor (Optional)

**PyAhmia works without Tor, but you can enable routing traffic through Tor if you want.**

When this is enabled, it will use Ahmia's darknet url instead of the
clearnet variant.

To enable routing through Tor, you can call `ahmia` with the `-t, --use-tor` flag.
This assumes the tor service is running in the background, otherwise, the command will fail before you can say "hidden
wiki".

If Tor is not installed, you can check out the installation scripts located
in [pyahmia/scripts](https://github.com/escrapism/pyahmia/tree/master/scripts).

*example*:

```commandline
ahmia QUERY --use-tor
```

### Exporting Output

PyAhmia only supports exporting data to csv files (for now), and in order to export, you'll need to specify the
`-e, --export` flag.
This will export your search results to a file named after your search query.

*example*:

```commandline
ahmia QUERY --export
```

### Filtering Results by Time Period

Results can be filtered by 3 time periods (day, week, month). By default, results will be taken from all time periods (
all). You can change this by using the `-p, --period` option, and pass the time period you want to get results from.

*example*:

```commandline
ahmia QUERY --period week
```
