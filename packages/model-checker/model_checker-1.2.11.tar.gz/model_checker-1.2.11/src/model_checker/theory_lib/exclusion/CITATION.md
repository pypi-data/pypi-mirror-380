## Semantic Theory Citations

The unilateral semantics was originally conceived of by Kit Fine:

```bibtex
@article{fine_truthmaker_i,
  author = {Kit Fine},
  title = {A Theory of Truthmaker Content I: Conjunction, Disjunction and Negation},
  journal = {Journal of Philosophical Logic},
  volume = {46},
  number = {6},
  pages = {625--674},
  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.1007/s10992-016-9413-y}
}
```

The version implemented follows Champollion and Bernard's revision of Fine's semantics:

```bibtex
@article{champollion_bernard_unilateral,
  author = {Lucas Champollion and Timoth√©e Bernard},
  title = {Negation and Modality in Unilateral Truthmaker Semantics},
  journal = {Linguistics and Philosophy},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1007/s10988-023-09407-z}
}
```
