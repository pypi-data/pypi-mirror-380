"""Test cases for pipeline field determining output directory structure.

These tests verify that:
1. Output directories are named after the pipeline field (not directory name)
2. Multiple flowgroups with same pipeline field generate to the same output directory
3. CLI --pipeline flag finds flowgroups by pipeline field across directories
4. State manager tracks files by pipeline field
5. Orchestrator discovers flowgroups by pipeline field
