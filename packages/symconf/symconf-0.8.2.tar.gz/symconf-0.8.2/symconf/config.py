"""
Primary config management abstractions

The config map is a dict mapping from config file **path names** to their
absolute path locations. That is,

.. code-block:: sh

    <config_path_name>
    ->
    <config_dir>/apps/<app_name>/<subdir>/<palette>-<scheme>.<config_path_name>

For example,

.. code-block:: sh

    palette1-light.conf.ini
    ->
    ~/.config/symconf/apps/user/palette1-light.conf.ini

    palette2-dark.app.conf
    ->
    ~/.config/symconf/apps/generated/palette2-dark.app.conf

This ensures we have unique config names pointing to appropriate locations
(which is mostly important when the same config file names are present across
``user`` and ``generated`` subdirectories; unique path names need to be
resolved to unique path locations).

        """
        Find matching template files for provided template groups.

        For template groups other than "scheme" and "style," this method
        performs a basic search for matching filenames in the respective group
        directory. For example, a KW group like ``font = "mono"`` would look
        for ``font/mono.toml`` (as well as the relaxation ``font/none.toml``).
        These template TOML files are stacked and ultimately presented to
        downstream config templates to be filled. Note how there is no
        dependence on the scheme during the filename match (e.g., we don't look
        for ``font/mono-dark.toml``).

        For "scheme" and "style," we have slightly different behavior, more
        closely aligning with the non-template matching. We don't have "scheme"
        and "style" template folders, but a single "theme" folder, within which
        we match template files just the same as we do for non-template config
        files. That is, we will look for files of the format

        .. code-block:: sh

            <style>-<scheme>.toml

        The only difference is that, while ``style`` can still include
        arbitrary style variants, it *must* have the form

        .. code-block:: sh

            <variant-1>-...-<variant-N>-<palette>

        if you want to match a ``palette`` template. Palettes are like regular
        template groups, and should be placed in their own template folder. But
        when applying those palette colors, they almost always need to be
        coupled with a scheme setting (e.g., "solarized-dark"). This is the one
        place where the templating system allows "intermediate templates:" raw
        palette colors can fill theme templates, which then fill user config
        templates.

        So in summary: palette files can be used to populate theme templates by
        providing a style string that matches the format
        ``<variant>-<palette>``. The ``<palette>`` will be extracted and used
        to match filenames in the palette template folder. The term
        ``<variant>-<palette>-<scheme>`` will be used to match templates in the
        theme folder, where ``<variant>-<palette> = <style>`` and ``<scheme>``
        are independently specifiable with supported for ``auto``, ``none``,
        etc.

        Note that "strictness" doesn't really apply in this setting. In the
        non-template config matching setting, setting strict means there's no
        relaxation to "none," but here, any "none" group template files just
        help fill any gaps (but are otherwise totally overwritten, even if
        matched, by more precise matches). You can match ``nones`` directly if
        you want by specifying that directly. ``get_matching_scripts()`` is
        similar in this sense.

        Unique config file path names are written to the file map in order of

        ``<style>-<scheme>.<path-name>``, where ``<style>-<scheme>`` is the
        "theme part" and ``<path-name>`` is the "conf part." For those config
        files with the same "conf part," only the entry with the most specific
        "theme part" will be stored. By "most specific," we mean those entries
        with the fewest possible components named ``none``, with ties broken in
        favor of a more specific ``style`` (the only "tie" really possible here
        is when ``none-<scheme>`` and ``<style>-none`` are both available, in
        which case the latter will overwrite the former).

        .. admonition:: Edge cases

            There are a few quirks to this matching scheme that yield
            potentially unintuitive results. As a recap:

            - The "theme part" of a config file name includes both a style
              (palette and more) and a scheme component. Either of those parts
              may be "none," which simply indicates that that particular file
              does not attempt to change that factor. "none-light," for
              instance, might simply set a light background, having no effect
              on other theme settings.
            - Non-keyword queries for scheme and style will always be matched
              exactly. However, if an exact match is not available, we also
              look for "none" in each component's place. For example, if we
              wanted to set "solarized-light" but only "none-light" was
              available, it would still be set because we can still satisfy the
              desire scheme (light). The same goes for the style specification,
              and if neither match, "none-none" will always be matched if
              available. Note that if "none" is specified exactly, it will be
              matched exactly, just like any other value.
            - During a query, "any" may also be specified for either component,
              indicating we're okay to match any file's text for that part. For
              example, if I have two config files ``"p1-dark"`` and
              ``"p2-dark"``, the query for ``("any", "dark")`` would suggest
              I'd like the dark scheme but am okay with either style.

            It's under the "any" keyword where possibly counter-intuitive
            results may come about. Specifying "any" does not change the
            mechanism that seeks to optionally match "none" if no specific
            match is available. For example, suppose we have the config file
            ``red-none`` (setting red colors regardless of a light/dark mode).
            If I query for ``("any", "dark")``, ``red-none`` will be matched
            (supposing there are no more direct matches available). Because we
            don't a match specifically for the scheme "dark," it gets relaxed
            to "none." But we indicated we're okay to match any style. So
            despite asking for a config that sets a dark scheme and not caring
            about the style, we end up with a config that explicitly does
            nothing about the scheme but sets a particular style. This matching
            process is still consistent with what we expect the keywords to do,
            it just slightly muddies the waters with regard to what can be
            matched (mostly due to the amount that's happening under the hood
            here).

            This example is the primary driver behind the optional ``strict``
            setting, which in this case would force the dark scheme to be
            matched (and ultimately find no matches).

            Also: when "any" is used for a component, options with "none" are
            prioritized, allowing "any" to be as flexible and unassuming as
            possible (only matching a random specific config among the options
            if there is no "none" available).

        .. admonition:: Logic overview

            This method is the center point of the ConfigManager class. It
            unifies the user and template matching, file generation, setting of
            symlinks, and running of scripts. At a high level,

            1. An app name (e.g., kitty), app settings (e.g., a ``config_dir``
               or ``config_map``), scheme (e.g., "dark"), and style (e.g.,
               "soft-gruvbox")
            2. Get matching user config files via ``get_matching_configs()``
            3. Get matching template config files and the aggregate template
               dict via ``get_matching_templates()``
            4. Interleave the two result sets by pathname and match quality.
               Template matches are preferred in the case of tied scores. This
               resolves any pathname clashes across matching files.

               This is a particularly important step. It compares concrete
               config names explicitly provided by the user (e.g.,
               ``soft-gruvbox-dark.kitty.conf``) with named TOML files in a
               group directory (e.g,. ``theme/soft-gruvbox-dark.toml``). We
               have to determine whether the available templates constitute a
               better match than the best user option, which is done by
               comparing the level in the prefix order (the index) where the
               match takes place.

               Templates are generally more flexible, and other keywords may
               also provide a matching template group (e.g., ``-T font=mono``
               to match some font-specific settings). When the match is
               otherwise equally good (e.g., both style and scheme match
               directly), we prefer the template due to its general portability
               and likelihood of being more up-to-date. We also don't
               explicitly use the fact auxiliary template groups might be
               matched by the user's input: we only compare the user and
               template configs on the basis of the quality of the style-scheme
               match. This effectively means additional template groups (e.g.,
               font) don't "count" if the basis style-scheme doesn't win over a
               user config file. There could be an arbitrary number of other
               template group matches, but they don't contribute to the match
               quality. For instance, a concrete user config
               ``solarized-dark.kitty.conf`` will be selected over
               ``solarized-none.toml`` plus 10 other matching theme elements if
               the user asked for ``-s dark -t solarized``.
            5. For those template matches, fill/generate the template file and
               place it in the app's ``generated/`` directory.
