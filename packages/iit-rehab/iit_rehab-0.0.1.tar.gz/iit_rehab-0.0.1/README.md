# IIT Rehab Collaboration
This project is a collaboration with IIT.
Our team was tasked with integrating our controller into their software for their exo-suit.

## Install
To install the library run: `pip install iit-rehab`

## Development
0. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
1. `make init` to create the virtual environment and install dependencies
2. `make format` to format the code and check for errors
3. `make test` to run the test suite
4. `make clean` to delete the temporary files and directories
5. `poetry publish --build` to build and publish to https://pypi.org/project/iit-rehab


## Usage
```
"""Basic usage for our module."""

def main() -> None:
    """Run a simple demonstration."""
    # Initialize system
    estimator = GaitPhaseEstimator(AOParameters())
    controller = LowLevelController()
    plotter = RealtimeAOPlotter() if args.real_time else None

    if plotter:
        logger.info("Starting Dash app for real-time plotting.")
        plotter.run()

    logger.info("Replaying log file with controller.")
    time_data, theta_il, theta_hat, phi_gp, omegas = run_controller_loop(
        log_data, estimator, controller, plotter=plotter
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Connecting to RaspberryPi
There is no static IP address, so you will need to connect the device to a monitor first.
On powerup, the IP address is shown so if you are quick, you won't need a keyboard or mouse to find it with `ifconfig -a`

I suggest copying files with rsync:
```rsync -auv rehab@<IP_ADDR>:~/Desktop ~/Desktop/rehab_iit```

Connect to rehab with the above IP address while using featherexo as the password.
```
ssh rehab@10.183.89.195
```

## Results
The plot below shows the results being plotted in real time.
