# 🧾 CleanDB

### A Lightweight Data Cleaning and Quality Solution for Text-Based Structured Data

**CleanDB** is a **Python-native, zero-dependency** utility for managing structured `.txt` files. Perfect when full database integration is overkill using simple 1D/2D list logic.

Ideal for microservices, pipelines, automation scripts, bots, or lightweight data auditing.

---

## 📦 Features

* ✅ **Structured Data Enforcement** (1D or 2D)
* ✍️ **Write, Read, Append, and Delete** with built-in validation
* 🔍 **SQL-style read filtering** by column index
* 🧹 **Selective delete**, **file trimming**, and cleanup
* 🎗️ **Multi-console safe** (handles concurrent access)
* 💾 **Manual backups** and **timed snapshots**
* 🧪 **Debug tool** with auto-fix for invalid rows
* 🗂️ Organized folder structure with versioned files
* 🔐 **File hiding/unhiding** with access controls
* 🗃️ **Zero external dependencies**
* 💪 **Tamper-resistant** and structure-locked

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install cleandb
```

### ♻️ Upgrade

```bash
pip install --upgrade cleandb
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
import cleandb as db

db.w("tasks", [["Read", "Done"], ["Code", "Pending"]])
db.a("tasks", [["Test", "Pending"]])
print(db.r("tasks"))

db.d("tasks", del_list=["Done"], index=1)
db.backup("tasks")
db.snapshot("tasks", unit="h", gap=6)
```

---

## 🧰 Function Overview

### 🔄 Write

```python
w(txt_name, write_list, is2d=None)
```

* Overwrites file content with a validated structure.
* Use `is2d=True` for 2D data, `False` for 1D.
* Use `[]` to reset file and structure lock.

---

### 📖 Read

```python
r(txt_name, index=None, set_new=[], notify_new=True)
```

* Reads file contents.
* Optional filtering using index (single or list).
* If file doesn’t exist, creates and returns `set_new`.

---

### ➕ Append

```python
a(txt_name, append_list, is2d=None)
```

* Appends rows to the file.
* Must match existing structure.
* `is2d` required if appending to a new file.

---

### ❌ Delete

```python
d(txt_name, del_list=[], index=None, cutoff=None, keep=None, reverse=False, size=None)
```

* Deletes matching rows using flexible criteria:

  * `index`: single, list, or `"*"` (match entire row)
  * `cutoff`: max deletions per value
  * `keep`: retain only N matches
  * `reverse`: delete from end
  * `size`: trim file to last N rows

---

### 💾 Backup

```python
backup(txt_name, display=True)
```

* Manual backup of a file.
* Use `*` to back up all files.

---

### ⏱ Snapshot

```python
snapshot(txt_name, unit, gap, trim=None, begin=0, display=True)
```

* Time-based snapshot after `gap` duration.
* Units: `'s'`, `'m'`, `'h'`, `'d'`, `'mo'`, `'y'`

---

### 🧹 Debug

```python
debug(txt_name, is2d=None, length=None, display=True)
```

* Finds structural issues (e.g., wrong row lengths).

---

### 🧨 Remove File

```python
remove(txt_name, display=True)
```

* Deletes file and all its backups.

---

### 🙈 Hide / Unhide

```python
hide(txt_name, display=True)
unhide(txt_name, display=True)
```

* Hide or unhide files.
* Use `*` for all files.

---

### 📋 List Files

```python
listdir(display=True)
```

* Lists all stored file names.

---

### ℹ️ File Info

```python
info(txt_name, display=True)
describe(txt_name, display=True)
```

* Shows metadata: type, shape, row count, etc.

## 👉 1D List Example

```python
# Create a 1D file
db.w("shopping_list", ["Apples", "Bread", "Milk"], is2d=False)
# is2d=False is a must only for 1D list on first write / append or after a validation reset.

# Append a new item
db.a("shopping_list", ["Eggs"])

# Read all items
print(db.r("shopping_list"))           # ['Apples', 'Bread', 'Milk', 'Eggs']
print(db.r("shopping_list", index=1))  # 'Bread'

# Delete items
db.d("shopping_list", "Milk")
db.d("shopping_list", ["Bread", "Eggs"])
```

---

## 👉 2D List Example

```python
tasks = [
    ["Read Docs", "Done", "Low"],
    ["Fix Bug", "Pending", "High"],
    ["Write Tests", "Pending", "Medium"],
    ["Deploy", "In Progress", "High"],
    ["Fix Bug", "Done", "Low"]
]

db.w("task_board", tasks)
```

---

### 🧹 Delete Workflow (Structured & Clear)

#### 1️⃣ Delete rows where Priority is "Low"

```python
db.d("task_board", del_list=["Low"], index=2)
```

#### 2️⃣ Delete an exact row

```python
db.d("task_board", del_list=[["Fix Bug", "Pending", "High"]], index="*")
```

#### 3️⃣ Delete by partial match on Task

```python
db.d("task_board", del_list=[["Deploy"], ["Write Tests"]], index=0)
```

#### 4️⃣ Delete rows where Status = "Done" and Priority = "High"

```python
db.d("task_board", del_list=[["Done", "High"]], index=[1, 2])
```

#### 5️⃣ Trim file to last 2 rows

```python
db.d("task_board", size=2)
```

#### 6️⃣ Clean invalid rows

```python
db.debug("task_board", is2d=True, length=3)
```

---

### 💾 Backup & Snapshot

```python
db.backup("task_board")
db.snapshot("task_board", unit="h", gap=6, trim=10)
```

---

## 🧪 Advanced Delete: cutoff, keep, size

```python
tasks = [
    ["Read Docs", "Done"],
    ["Fix Bug", "Pending"],
    ["Write Tests", "Pending"],
    ["Deploy", "Pending"],
    ["Fix Bug", "Done"],
    ["Write Tests", "Done"],
    ["Fix Bug", "Pending"],
    ["Deploy", "Done"]
]

db.w("task_board", tasks)

# 1️⃣ Delete up to 2 rows where Status == "Pending"
db.d("task_board", del_list=["Pending"], index=1, cutoff=2)

# 2️⃣ Keep only 1 "Fix Bug" row
db.d("task_board", del_list=["Fix Bug"], index=0, keep=1)

# 3️⃣ Keep only last 4 rows
db.d("task_board", size=4)
```

## 📂 Backup & Recovery

* 🔄 **Backups** are stored in: `Backup 💾/`
* 📸 **Snapshots** are stored in: `Snapshot 📸/`
* 🔁 **Restore:** Just copy desired file back to the main data directory.

---

## 🧠 Notes

* **Structure Locking:** On first write/append, shape (1D/2D) and length are saved.
* Use `w("file", [])` to reset structure.
* Only list data is supported.
* All operations auto-sync with backups.

---

## 🛡 Best Practices

* Always use CleanDB methods (`w()`, `a()`, `d()`, etc.).
* Avoid manual file edits — validation will fail.
* Use `debug()` when operations fail unexpectedly.
* Automate `snapshot()` for long-running apps.
