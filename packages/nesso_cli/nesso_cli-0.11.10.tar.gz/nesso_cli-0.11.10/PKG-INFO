The [CLI](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_cli.asp) interface of the [nesso data platform].

## Features

- [x] simplify and automate data modelling
- [x] simplify and automate metadata generation
- [x] manage nesso project configuration
- [ ] simplify and automate job scheduling (coming soon!)

## Where does nesso-cli fit in?

Currently, nesso-cli contains a single module, `models` (`nesso models`), which is used for the T in ELTC (Extract, Load, Transform, Catalog), sitting between data ingestion (`viadot`) and metadata ingestion (`luma-cli`):

![Where does nesso-cli fit](docs/_static/where_nesso_cli_fits.png)

In the future, nesso-cli will include additional modules to allow interacting with different components of the nesso data platform through a unified interface.

The next planned module is `jobs`, which will allow creating and scheduling EL and ELTC jobs via a simple CLI interface. Currently, this is done by creating jobs manually in Python and then manually scheduling them in Prefect. We hope to replace this tedious and error-prone (though repeatable) process with simple commands, such as `nesso jobs deployment create --job my_job --schedule "0 0 * * *"`, as well as interactive commands which will guide user through a set of limited choices, such as `nesso jobs job create`.
