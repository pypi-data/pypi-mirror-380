base package for `psr`, including base classes for tree structures, function units, and functions
(mathematical expressions).

This package provides foundational classes and utilities for building and manipulating tree
structures, function units, and mathematical expressions within the PSR (Python Symbolic
Representation) framework. It serves as the core module that other components of the PSR framework
can build upon.
