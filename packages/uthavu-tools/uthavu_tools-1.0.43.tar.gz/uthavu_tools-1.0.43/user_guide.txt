Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: nginx). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: uthavu.com
  Type:   connection
  Detail: During secondary validation: 162.215.226.4: Fetching http://: Invalid empty host in redirect target

  Domain: www.uthavu.com
  Type:   connection
  Detail: During secondary validation: 162.215.226.4: Fetching http://: Invalid empty host in redirect target

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to verify the temporary nginx configuration changes made by Certbot. Ensure the listed domains point to this nginx server and that it is accessible from the internet.
