# Control-lab-ly
Lab Equipment Automation Package

## Description
User-friendly package that simplifies the definition and control of reconfigurable setups for high-throughput experimentation and machine learning.

## Installation
[Control-lab-ly](https://pypi.org/project/control-lab-ly/) can be found on PyPI and can be easily installed with `pip install`.
```shell
$ python -m pip install control-lab-ly[all]
```

## Quickstart
Import the desired class from the library and initialize to use.
