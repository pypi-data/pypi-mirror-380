<p>Welcome to the ABIF Web Tool (awt), an online tool for analyzing elections using multiple voting methods including IRV/RCV, Approval, STAR, and Condorcet/Copeland.  ABIF is the "<a href="https://electowiki.org/wiki/ABIF">Aggregated Ballot Information Format</a>", which is a reasonably simple way to express election results, whether those elections were conducted with ranked (ordinal) ballots, rated (cardinal) ballots, or just a list of checkboxes next to the candidates (as done with plurality and approval elections).</p>
