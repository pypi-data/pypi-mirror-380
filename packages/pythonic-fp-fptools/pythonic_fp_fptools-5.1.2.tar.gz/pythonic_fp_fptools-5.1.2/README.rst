Pythonic FP - Functional tools
==============================

PyPI project
`pythonic-fp.fptools
<https://pypi.org/project/pythonic-fp.fptools>`_.

Tools to aid with functional programming in Python while still
endeavoring to be Pythonic.

- Functions as first class objects
- Lazy (non-strict) function evaluation
- Maybe monad - representing a possible missing value
- Either monad - representing either a LEFT or RIGHT value, not both

  - left biased

- State monad implementation

  - pure FP handling of state (the state monad)
  - Classic FP implementation

    - the monad encapsulates a state transformation, not a "state"
