## Installation
Clone the repository and pip install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spill-Tea/DesignerDNA.git
cd DesignerDNA
pip install .
```

Alternatively, you may install directly from github.
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Spill-Tea/DesignerDNA@main
```


## For Developers
After cloning the repository, create a new virtual environment and run the following
commands:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Running unit tests locally is straightforward with tox. Make sure you have all python
versions available required for your project. The `p` flag is not required, but it runs
tox environments in parallel.
```bash
tox -p
```
Be sure to run tox before creating a pull request.
