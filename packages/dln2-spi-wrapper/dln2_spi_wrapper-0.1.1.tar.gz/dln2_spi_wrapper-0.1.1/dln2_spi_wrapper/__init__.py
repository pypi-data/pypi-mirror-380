DLN2 SPI Wrapper - A Python library for interfacing with DLN2 SPI adapters.

This package provides a spidev-compatible API for working with DLN2 USB-to-SPI
adapters, allowing existing spidev-based code to work with DLN2 devices with
minimal modifications.

Main components:
- dln2_spi_client: Low-level DLN2 USB communication
- dln2_spidev: High-level spidev-compatible API
- SpiDev: Main class for SPI communication
