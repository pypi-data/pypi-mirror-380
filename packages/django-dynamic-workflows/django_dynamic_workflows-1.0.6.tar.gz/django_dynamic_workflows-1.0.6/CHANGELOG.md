## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-28

### üîß DRF Spectacular Compatibility Fixes
- **Fixed type hint warnings**: Added `@extend_schema_field` decorators to all SerializerMethodField methods in serializers
- **Resolved GenericForeignKey warnings**: Created custom `GenericForeignKeyField` to properly handle Pipeline.department field serialization
- **Enhanced API documentation**: All serializer method fields now have proper type annotations for OpenAPI schema generation
- **Improved field resolution**: Replaced direct department field usage with department_detail field using custom serializer

### üìã Technical Improvements
- **Added drf-spectacular import**: Imported extend_schema_field decorator for type hint support
- **Custom field implementation**: Created GenericForeignKeyField class for consistent GenericForeignKey serialization
- **Type safety**: All SerializerMethodField methods now have explicit return type declarations

- Eliminated DRF Spectacular W001 warnings across all serializers

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-28

### üöÄ Complete Resubmission & Delegation Implementation
- **Enhanced resubmission logic**: Implemented proper `after_resubmission` handler with stage transitions and workflow event triggers
- **Added delegation logic**: New `after_delegate` handler with delegate user assignment and workflow event integration
- **WorkflowApprovalSerializer integration**: All approval actions (approve, reject, delegate, resubmission) now use `advance_flow` with proper parameter passing
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Completely rewritten flow tests using WorkflowApprovalSerializer instead of manual assignment

### üîß Workflow Engine Improvements
- **Handler integration**: Added `ActionType.AFTER_DELEGATE` and `ActionType.AFTER_RESUBMISSION` workflow event triggers
- **Stage transition logic**: Resubmission properly updates workflow attachment to target resubmission stage
- **Metadata tracking**: Resubmission steps include `resubmission_stage_id` in extra_fields for audit trail
- **Error handling**: Improved error handling and validation in serializer save method

### üìã Testing & Validation
- **advance_flow integration tests**: Added comprehensive mocking tests to verify correct parameter passing to approval workflow
- **End-to-end flow tests**: New tests validate complete approval progression using proper serializer patterns
- **Real workflow simulation**: Tests now use actual WorkflowApprovalSerializer patterns from production implementations

### üìö Documentation Updates
- **Feature highlights**: Updated README with new resubmission and delegation capabilities
- **Implementation notes**: Added documentation about workflow event triggers and stage transitions
- **Known limitations**: Documented step number conflict issue in approval workflow package for resubmission edge cases

## [1.0.4] - 2025-09-27

### üîÑ Clone Tracking & API Improvements
- **Added `cloned_from` field**: All workflow models (WorkFlow, Pipeline, Stage) now automatically track their clone origin
- **Enhanced clone functionality**: Base clone method automatically sets clone relationships and handles field copying
- **Improved API consistency**: Renamed `department_object_id` to `department_id` for cleaner, more intuitive API

### üìö Configuration Documentation
- **Comprehensive configuration guide**: Added detailed DEPARTMENT_MODEL setting documentation to README
- **Flexible department mapping**: Document support for mapping departments to any model (custom models, auth.Group, etc.)
- **Developer-friendly examples**: Enhanced configuration examples with real-world use cases

### üõ† Technical Improvements
- **Optimized service functions**: Enhanced workflow data retrieval functions with better performance
- **Updated migrations**: Clean field renaming with proper migration handling
- **Code quality**: Applied formatting improvements with isort and black

### üìã Migration Notes
- **Seamless upgrade**: Field rename handled transparently in migrations
- **No breaking changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **130 tests passing**: Full test coverage maintained

## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-27

### üîß Model Updates
- Allowed `null=True` on timestamp and related fields to improve migration flexibility
- Ensures smoother installation on existing databases without requiring defaults

### üõ† Migration Notes
- If upgrading from `1.0.2`, run migrations to apply the `null=True` changes
