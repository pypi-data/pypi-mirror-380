## Use Case Extensions

Using the Dataspace SDK and the Industry SDK here in this folder you have the posibility of including our specific backend add-on use case rules, so you can extend the funcionality of the SDK.

Example:
- if you want to do a specific operatation for certificate management or PCF, or any other use case.


This code will be independant from the Industry Core Hub and will be supported by multiple applications that develop with the SDK.
