class BrowserPOM(Browser):
    """*PageObjectLibrary* is a lightweight library which supports using
    the page object pattern with
    [https://robotframework-browser.org/|BrowserLibrary].
    This library does not replace BrowserLibrary; rather, it
    provides a framework around which to use BrowserLibrary and the
    lower-level [http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org/|Python
    bindings to Playwright]

    This library provides the following keywords:

    | =Keyword Name=             | =Synopsis= |
    | Go to page                 | Goes to the given page in the browser |
    | The current page should be | Assert that the given page is displayed in the browser |

    PageObjectLibrary provides a PageObject class which should be used
    as the base class for other page objects. By inheriting from this
    class your keywords have access to the following pre-defined
    attributes and methods:

    | =Attribute/method=  | =Description=                             |
    | ``self.browser`` | A reference to the BrowserLibrary Reference  |
    | ``self.locator`` | A wrapper around the ``_locators`` dictionary        |
    | ``self.logger``  | A reference to the ``robot.api.logger`` instance     |

    = Using BrowserLibrary Keywords =

    Within your keywords you have access to the full power of
    BrowserLibrary. You can use ``self.browser`` to access the
    library keywords. The following example shows how to call the
    ``Capture Page Screenshot`` keyword:

    | self.browser.take_screenshot()

    = Creating Page Object Classes =

    Page objects should inherit from PageObjectLibrary.PageObject. At a minimum,
    the class should define the following attributes:

    | =Attribute= | =Description= |
    | ``PAGE_URL`` | The path to the current page, without the \
        hostname and port (eg: ``/dashboard.html``) |
    | ``PAGE_TITLE`` | The web page title. This is used by the \
        default implementation of ``_is_current_page``. |

    When using the keywords `Go To Page` or `The Current Page Should Be`, the
    PageObjectLibrary will call the method ``_is_current_page`` of the given page.
    By default this will compare the current page title to the ``PAGE_TITLE`` attribute
    of the page. If you are working on a site where the page titles are not unique,
    you can override this method to do any type of logic you need.

    = Page Objects are Normal Robot Libraries =

    All rules that apply to keyword libraries applies to page objects. For
    example, the libraries must be on ``PYTHONPATH``. You may also want to define
    ``ROBOT_LIBRARY_SCOPE``. Also, the filename and the classname must be identical (minus
    the ``.py`` suffix on the file).

    = Locators =

    When writing multiple keywords for a page, you often use the same locators in
    many places. PageObject allows you to define your locators in a dictionary,
    but them use them with a more convenient dot notation.

    To define locators, create a dictionary named ``_locators``. You can then access
    the locators via dot notation within your keywords as ``self.locator.<name>``. The
    ``_locators`` dictionary may have nested dictionaries.

    = Waiting for a Page to be Ready =

    One difficulty with writing Selenium tests is knowing when a page has refreshed.
    PageObject provides a context manager named ``_wait_for_page_refresh()`` which can
    be used to wrap a command that should result in a page refresh. It will get a
    reference to the DOM, run the body of the context manager, and then wait for the
    DOM to change before returning.

    = Example Page Object Definition =

    | from PageObjectLibrary import PageObject
    | from robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn
    |
    | class LoginPage(PageObject):
    |     PAGE_TITLE = "Login - PageObjectLibrary Demo"
    |     PAGE_URL = "/"
    |
    |    _locators = {
    |        "username": "id=id_username",
    |        "password": "id=id_password",
    |        "submit_button": "id=id_submit",
    |    }
