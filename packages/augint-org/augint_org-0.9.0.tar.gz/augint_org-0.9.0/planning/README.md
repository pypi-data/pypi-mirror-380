1. **Initial Design Decisions** - Why certain architectural choices were made
2. **Migration Strategy** - How we planned to move from legacy systems
3. **Feature Specifications** - Detailed requirements for CLI commands and functionality
4. **Implementation Plans** - Step-by-step guides that were followed during development

## Status

Most of these documents have been superseded by the main documentation in `/docs`. They are kept here for:

- Historical context
- Understanding design evolution
- Reference for similar projects
- Audit trail of decisions
