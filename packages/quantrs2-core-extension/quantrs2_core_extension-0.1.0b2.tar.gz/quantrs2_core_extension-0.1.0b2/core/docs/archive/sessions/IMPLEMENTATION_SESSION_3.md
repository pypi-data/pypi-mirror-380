### 3. ZX-Calculus Implementation

**Files**: `zx_calculus.rs`, `zx_extraction.rs`, `optimization/zx_optimizer.rs`

2. **Identity Removal**: Phase-0 spiders with degree 2 can be eliminated
3. **Color Change**: Convert between X and Z spiders
4. **Pi-Copy**: Pauli spiders can be copied through
5. **Bialgebra**: X-Z spider interaction rules

#### Circuit Interface:
- **Circuit to ZX**: Converts quantum circuits to ZX-diagrams
- **ZX to Circuit**: Extracts optimized circuits from diagrams
- **Optimization Pass**: Integrates with existing optimization framework

#### Visualization:
- DOT format export for GraphViz visualization
- Visual debugging of optimization process

### 4. Integration and Testing

- **Gate Understanding**: Characterization helps in synthesis and verification
- **T-Count Reduction**: Critical for fault-tolerant quantum computing
- **Research Tools**: Foundation for advanced quantum algorithms

## Next Steps

The remaining medium-priority tasks are:
1. Quantum Shannon decomposition using SVD
