===================
Configuration Guide
===================

Mistral configuration is needed for getting Mistral work correctly
either with real OpenStack environment or without OpenStack environment.

**NOTE:** Most of the following operations should be performed in mistral
directory.

#. Generate *mistral.conf* (if it does not already exist)::

    $ oslo-config-generator \
      --config-file tools/config/config-generator.mistral.conf \
      --output-file /etc/mistral/mistral.conf

#. Edit file **/etc/mistral/mistral.conf**.

#. **If you are not using OpenStack, skip this item.** Provide valid keystone
   auth properties::

    [keystone_authtoken]
    www_authenticate_uri = http://keystone1.example.com:5000/v3
    identity_uri = http://<keystone-host:5000
    auth_version = v3
    admin_user = <user>
    admin_password = <password>
    admin_tenant_name = <tenant>

#. Mistral can be also configured to authenticate with Keycloak server
   via OpenID Connect protocol. In order to enable Keycloak authentication,
   the following section should be in the config file::

    auth_type = keycloak-oidc

    [keycloak_oidc]
    auth_url = https://<keycloak-server-host>:<keycloak-server-port>/auth

   Property ``auth_type`` is assigned to ``keystone`` by default.
   If SSL/TLS verification needs to be disabled then ``insecure = True``
   should also be added under ``[keycloak_oidc]`` group.

#. If you want to configure SSL for Mistral API server, provide following
   options in config file::

    [api]
    enable_ssl_api = True

    [ssl]
    ca_file = <path-to-ca file>
    cert_file = <path-to-certificate file>
    key_file = <path-to-key file>

#. **If you don't use OpenStack or you want to disable authentication for the
   Mistral service**, provide ``auth_enable = False`` in the config file::

    [pecan]
    auth_enable = False

#. **If you are not using OpenStack, skip this item**. Register Mistral service
   and Mistral endpoints on Keystone::

    $ MISTRAL_URL="http://[host]:[port]/v2"
    $ openstack service create workflowv2 --name mistral \
      --description 'OpenStack Workflow service'
    $ openstack endpoint create workflowv2 public $MISTRAL_URL
    $ openstack endpoint create workflowv2 internal $MISTRAL_URL
    $ openstack endpoint create workflowv2 admin $MISTRAL_URL

#. Configure transport properties in the ``[DEFAULT]`` section::

    [DEFAULT]
    transport_url = rabbit://<user_id>:<password>@<host>:5672/

#. Configure database. **SQLite can't be used in production; use MySQL or
   PostgreSQL instead.** Here are the steps how to connect *MySQL* DB to
   Mistral:

   Make sure you have installed ``mysql-server`` package on your database
   machine (it can be your Mistral machine as well).

   Install MySQL driver for python::

    $ pip install PyMySQL

   Create the database and grant privileges::

    # mysql

    CREATE DATABASE mistral;
    USE mistral
    GRANT ALL ON mistral.* TO 'root'@<database-host> IDENTIFIED BY <password>;

   Configure connection in Mistral config::

    [database]
    connection = mysql+pymysql://<user>:<password>@<database-host>:3306/mistral

   **NOTE**: If PostgreSQL is used, configure connection item as below::

    connection = postgresql://<user>:<password>@<database-host>:5432/mistral

#. **If you are not using OpenStack, skip this item.**
   Update ``mistral/actions/openstack/mapping.json`` file which contains all
   allowed OpenStack actions, according to the specific client versions
   of OpenStack projects in your deployment. Please find more detailed
   information in ``tools/get_action_list.py`` script.

#. Configure merge strategy feature if needed, It is needed to change default
   Mistral variable interaction behavior of replacing one variable with another
   inside own context.
   For eg::

      version: '2.0'
      wf:
      input:
      - aa:
            bb: wf_ex_input
            cc: wf_ex_input
            zz: wf_ex_input
      output:
         aa: <% $.aa %>
      tasks:
         task1:
            action: std.echo
            # emulate some action result
            input:
            output:
               cc: task1_res
               dd: task1_res
            on-success: [task2]
            publish:
            aa:
               cc: <% task().result["cc"] %>
               dd: <% task().result["dd"] %>
         task2:
            action: std.echo
            # emulate some action result
            input:
            output:
               bb: task2_res
            publish:
            aa:
               bb: <% task().result["bb"] %>

   Default result of execution is::

      {
         "aa": {
            "bb": "task2_res"
         }
      }

   To merge results of tasks, we need to use flat data structure or the yaql
   merge function.
   merge_strategy config has following options:

   * `replace` - It is the default value. It is an old behavior when variable replace each other in context.
   * `merge` - If you set this value, variable is merged with other context.

   Consider `merge` strategy with the same workflow as above. The result is::

      {
         "aa" : {
            "bb": "task2_res",
            "cc": "task1_res",
            "dd": "task1_res",
            "zz": "wf_ex_input",
         }
      }

   merge_strategy can be configured as the following::

      [engine]
      merge_strategy = replace

#. Configure Task affinity feature if needed. It is needed for distinguishing
   either single task executor or one task executor from group of task
   executors::

    [executor]
    host = my_favorite_executor

   Then, this executor can be referred in Workflow Language by

   .. code-block:: yaml

    ...Workflow YAML...
    my_task:
      ...
      target: my_favorite_executor
    ...Workflow YAML...

#. Configure role based access policies for Mistral endpoints (policy.yaml)::

     [oslo_policy]
     policy_file = <path-of-policy.yaml file>

   Default policy.yaml file is in ``mistral/etc/``.
   For more details see `policy.yaml file
   <https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/admin/policy-yaml-file.html>`_.

#. Modify logging Configuration if needed

   The default log format is compatible with Graylog, however, it is possible
   to configure the log format. Mistral uses the library `oslo.log` for
   logging. For configuration information, refer to Official oslo.log
   Configuration at
   https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.log/latest/configuration/index.html.
   You can use the `root_execution_id` as follows::

      logging_context_format_string = [%(asctime)s,%(msecs)03d][%(levelname)-5s][category=%(name)s][pid=%(process)d][root_execution_id=%(root_execution_id)s] %(message)s

#. Modify the action execution reporting configuration if needed.

   It is possible that actions stuck in *"RUNNING"* state, for example if the
   assigned executor dies or the message that signals the completion of the
   action is lost. This section describes a heartbeat based solution to close
   these forgotten action executions. The related configuration options are
   ``max_missed_heartbeats`` and ``check_interval``. Note that if either
   of these options are *"0"* then the feature won't be enabled.

   The default configuration is the following::

     [action_heartbeat]
     max_missed_heartbeats = 15
     check_interval = 20
     first_heartbeat_timeout = 3600

   *"check_interval = 20"*, so check action executions every
   20 seconds. When the checker runs it will transit all running action
   executions to error if the last heartbeat received is older than *"20 \*
   15"* seconds. Note that *"first_heartbeat_timeout = 3600"*, so the action
   execution won't be closed for 3600 seconds if no heartbeat was received for
   it.

   - **max_missed_heartbeats**

    Defines the maximum amount of missed heartbeats to be allowed. If the number
    of missed heartbeats exceeds this number, then the related action execution
    will be transited to *"ERROR"* state with cause *"Heartbeat wasn't received."*.

   - **check_interval**

    The interval between checks (in seconds).

   - **first_heartbeat_timeout**

    The grace period for the first heartbeat (in seconds).

#. By default Mistral logs information about requests in HTTP action.
   To hide request headers and endpoint response in logs apply
   configuration like following::

      [action_logging]
      hide_response_body = True
      hide_request_body = True
      sensitive_headers = Header1, Header2

   Example above will make Mistral hide all response's bodies and hide
   Header1 and Header2 from requests in Mistral executor logs.

   - **hide_response_body**

    If this value is set to *True* then HTTP action response
    body will be hidden in logs. Default is *False*

   - **hide_request_body**

    If this value is set to *True* then HTTP action request
    body will be hidden in logs. Default is *False*

   - **sensitive_headers**

    List of sensitive headers that should be hidden in logs. Default is empty.

#. Configure event publishers. Event publishers are plugins that are
   optionally installed in the same virtual environment as Mistral.
   Event notification can be configured for all workflow execution for one or
   more event publishers. The configuration is under the notify param at the
   notifier section. The notify param is a list of dictionaries, one for each
   publisher identifying the type or the registered plugin name and additional
   key value pairs to be passed as kwargs into the publisher::

    [notifier]
    notify = [ {"type": "webhook", "url": "http://example.com", "headers": {"X-Auth-Token": "XXXX"}}, {"type": "custom_publisher"} ]

#. Configure info endpoint. Info endpoint could be used for exposing some
   important for support data in json format. This endpoint should be enabled
   manually. Store filled info file into environment where Mistral will be
   running.

   The default configuration is the following::

     [api]
     enable_info_endpoint = False
     info_json_file_path = info.json

#. Finally, try to run mistral engine and verify that it is running without
   any error::

     $ mistral-server --config-file <path-to-config> --server engine
