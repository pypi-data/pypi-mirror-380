           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Run, mock and test fake Snowflake databases locally.

## Install

```
pip install fakesnow
```

Or to install with the server:

```
pip install fakesnow[server]
```

## Usage

fakesnow offers two main approaches for faking Snowflake: [in-process patching](#in-process-patching) of the Snowflake Connector for Python or a [standalone HTTP server](#run-fakesnow-as-a-server).

Patching only applies to the current Python process. If a subprocess is spawned it won't be patched. For subprocesses, or for non-Python clients, use the server instead.

### In-process patching

To run script.py with patching:

```shell
fakesnow script.py
```

Or a module, eg: pytest

```shell
fakesnow -m pytest
```

`fakesnow` executes `fakesnow.patch` before running the script or module.

#### Use fakesnow.patch in your code

Alternatively, use fakesnow.patch in your code:

```python
import fakesnow
import snowflake.connector

with fakesnow.patch():
    conn = snowflake.connector.connect()

    print(conn.cursor().execute("SELECT 'Hello fake world!'").fetchone())
```

#### What gets patched

The following standard imports are automatically patched:

- `import snowflake.connector.connect`
- `import snowflake.connector.pandas_tools.write_pandas`

#### Handling "from ... import" Statements

To patch modules that use the `from ... import` syntax, you need to manually specify them, eg: if _mymodule.py_ contains:

```python
from snowflake.connector.pandas_tools import write_pandas
```

Then patch it using:

```python
with fakesnow.patch("mymodule.write_pandas"):
    ...
```

#### Database Persistence

By default, databases are in-memory and will be lost when the process ends. To persist databases between processes, specify a databases path:

```python
with fakesnow.patch(db_path="databases/"):
    ...
```

### Run fakesnow as a server

For scenarios where patching won't work (like subprocesses or non-Python clients), you can run fakesnow as an HTTP server.

#### From the command line

Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```
uvx 'fakesnow[server]' -s
```

Or from within a virtualenv that has `fakesnow[server]` installed:

```
fakesnow -s
```

By default the server listens on a random available port. Use `-p` to specify a port.

#### Within your python program

```python
import fakesnow
import snowflake.connector

# Start the fakesnow server in a context manager
# This yields connection kwargs (host, port, etc.)
with fakesnow.server() as conn_kwargs:
    # Connect to the fakesnow server using the yielded kwargs
    with snowflake.connector.connect(**conn_kwargs) as conn:
        print(conn.cursor().execute("SELECT 'Hello fake server!'").fetchone())

    # The server is automatically stopped when exiting the context manager
```

This starts an HTTP server in its own thread listening for requests on a random available port.

##### Server Configuration Options

To specify a port for the server:

```python
with fakesnow.server(port=12345) as conn_kwargs:
    ...
```

By default, the server uses a single in-memory database for its lifetime. To configure database persistence or isolation:

```python
# Databases will be saved to the "databases/" directory
with fakesnow.server(session_parameters={"FAKESNOW_DB_PATH": "databases/"}):
    ...

# Each connection gets its own isolated in-memory database
with fakesnow.server(session_parameters={"FAKESNOW_DB_PATH": ":isolated:"}):
    ...
```

#### Connecting from non-Python clients

The server is available via HTTP and accepts any username/password/account combination, eg:

```
user: fake
password: snow
account: fakesnow
host: localhost
port: <port number from server startup>
protocol: http
```

Additional parameters that may be helpful:
- Session parameter `CLIENT_OUT_OF_BAND_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` set to `false`
- Network timeout set to 1 second (since retries aren't needed in testing)

For example, with the Snowflake CLI:

```
snowsql -a fakesnow -u fake -p snow -h localhost -P <port> --protocol http
```

### pytest fixtures

fakesnow provides [fixtures](fakesnow/fixtures.py) for easier test integration. Add them in _conftest.py_:

```python
pytest_plugins = "fakesnow.fixtures"
```

To autouse the fixture you can wrap it like this in _conftest.py_:

```python
from typing import Iterator

import pytest

pytest_plugins = "fakesnow.fixtures"

@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def setup(_fakesnow_session: None) -> Iterator[None]:
    # the standard imports are now patched
    # Add any additional setup here
    yield
    # Add any teardown here
```

For code that uses `from ... import` statements:

```python
from typing import Iterator

import fakesnow
import pytest

pytest_plugins = "fakesnow.fixtures"

@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def _fakesnow_session() -> Iterator[None]:
    with fakesnow.patch("mymodule.write_pandas"):
        yield
```

#### server fixture

To start a fakesnow server instance, enable the plugin in _conftest.py_:

```python
pytest_plugins = "fakesnow.fixtures"
```

And then use the `fakesnow_server` session fixture like this:

```python
import snowflake.connector

def test_with_server(fakesnow_server: dict):
    # fakesnow_server contains connection kwargs (host, port, etc.)
    with snowflake.connector.connect(**fakesnow_server) as conn:
        conn.cursor().execute("SELECT 1")
        assert conn.cursor().fetchone() == (1,)
```

## Implementation coverage

Fully supported:

- Standard SQL operations and cursors
- Information schema queries
- Multiple databases
- [Parameter binding](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector-example#binding-data) in queries
- Table comments
- Pandas integration including [write_pandas(..)](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector-api#write_pandas)
- Result batch retrieval via [get_result_batches()](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector-api#get_result_batches)
- HTTP server for non-Python connectors

Partially supported:

- Date functions
- Regular expression functions
- Semi-structured data operations
- Tags
- User management
- Stages and PUT
- `COPY INTO` from S3 sources and stages, see [COPY INTO](#copy-into)

Not yet implemented:

- [Access control](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview)
- [Stored procedures](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/stored-procedures)

For more detail see the [test suite](tests/).

## Caveats

- Row ordering is non-deterministic and may differ from Snowflake unless you fully specify the ORDER BY clause.
- fakesnow supports a more liberal SQL dialect than actual Snowflake. This means some queries that work with fakesnow might not work with a real Snowflake instance.

## COPY INTO

`COPY INTO` can be used from S3 sources and stages. By default the standard AWS credential chain will be used. If you are getting an HTTP 403 or need to provide alternative S3 credentials you can use the duckdb [CREATE SECRET](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/httpfs/s3api) statement. For an example of creating a secret to use a moto S3 endpoint see `s3_client` in [conftest.py](tests/conftest.py#L80)
