        Perform precise string replacements with automatic backup and read-first safety.

        USAGE:
        - Targeted changes: Bug fixes, variable updates, line modifications
        - Code refactoring: Renaming throughout file (use replace_all=True)
        - Use write_file for: Complete rewrites, new files, major changes

        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
        - Must read file first to see exact formatting
        - Copy exact text including all whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)
        - Include enough context to make old_string unique

        EXAMPLES:
        edit_file('main.py', 'def old_name():', 'def new_name():')  # Single change
        edit_file('config.py', 'DEBUG = True', 'DEBUG = False', replace_all=True)  # All occurrences

        COMMON ERRORS:
        - "String not found": old_string doesn't match exactly (check whitespace)
        - "Must read file first": Required for safety

        Args:
            file_path: Path to file to edit
            old_string: Text to search for and replace
            new_string: Replacement text
            replace_all: If True, replace all occurrences; if False, replace first only

        Returns:
            Dict with edit results and metadata
