# Shack-Hartmann Wavefront Reconstruction module #

Based on previous work, this module contains a boiled down version of
the wavefront reconstruction algorithm written in Leonards master's 
thesis.

Some useful hints were provided by Jannik Esslinger.


## Regarding the reference: ##

There are two potential ways to define a reference:
1. reference image: The spot pattern is "the ground truth" so any
    time a config parameter changes (e.g. rotation, pitch, ...)
    the reference should be recalculated.
2. reference wavefront: The reconstructed wavefront from a reference
    image is "the ground truth". When changing e.g. the offset,
    the reference should not be recalculated.
In code, it is impossible to know which the user wants.

Mathematically speaking, both are described by the reference spots
shifting with respect to their nominal position at the center of
each lenslet. Since the entire reconstruction is based on linear
algebra, and in particular the inversion of the system of equations
is done with the constructed matrix, but without actual data,
there is no difference in applying the shift of reference first
or later (after reconstruction).
Therefore the possibility to add a reference early was omitted
completely! Instead, a reference wavefront can be subtracted later.
The user then has to take care to make sure it is based on the same
valid geometry parameters.

        While the internal pipeline settings (config, reference, matrix)
        can be easily applied internally, the `auxiliary_settings`
        dict provided for convenience is a passive dict.
        The caller has to then read the values from that dict and update
        their settings accordingly. E.g. the camera settings in
        WavesensorUI are reapplied with `camworker.apply_settings(...)`.
        Crucially, after that, the link in `auxiliary_settings` should
        be updated to reference the current camera settings dict.
        This way, the next save() can also include the current values, there.

        A word on calculation order:

          averaging raw images and then taking centroid yields same result
          as averaging centroid coordinates (assuming thresholding etc.
          are applied before raw image averaging)
        * reconstructing the wavefront from the spots is a linear operation
          (matrix multiplications only)
        * averaging is a linear operation (a sum and prefactor)
        * removing tip-tilt is a "linear operation", i.e. taking average first
          or averaging the tilt-removed wavefronts yields same result
        * more generally, adding/subtracting any constant grid (e.g. a Zernike
          mode like Tip, but also higher orders, and of course
          the `reference`) is "linear" in the above sense
        -> the order of these operations does not matter much, unless e.g.
          reference is changed on the fly
        -> decide here to do averaging first, such that changes to `reference`
          or `remove tilt` or `Zernike mode filtering` will apply in 1 cycle
