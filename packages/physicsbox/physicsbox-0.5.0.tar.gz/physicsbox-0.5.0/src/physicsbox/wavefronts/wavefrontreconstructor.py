"""
Core wavefront reconstruction class.

The class `ZonalWavefrontReconstructor` implements a zonal wavefront reconstruction
with arbitrary mask (circular pupil by parameter or arbitrary by dotmask).

The word wavefront and phasemap are used interchangeably here.

History
* 2018-05-25 ~LD created file during Master's thesis
* 2023-09-13 ~LD patched in modal (Zernike) reconstrcution code by
  jannik.esslinger@physik.uni-muenchen.de
* 2024-02-23 ~LD removed modal reconstruction for now,
  completely reworked (simplified) matrix building. Based on Janniks
  comment, masking certain lenslets no longer removes affected rows
  and columns from matrix, but simply sets them to 0. The reconstruction
  still seems to work, but code is far simpler.


## Theory

On the camera, a displacement $dx$/$dy$ of the spot centroid is measured
for each lenslet. The distance between the camera should be the focal
length of the lenslets $f$. (NB: If this is not exact, it goes into the
reconstruction as a linear factor, i.e. the phasemap is simply rescaled).
We can call this the slope $s$:

$$s = tan(\alpha) = dx/f$$



## Details on least-squares algorithm:

### scipy vs numpy

According to SO, since some versions the behaviour is identical:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29372559/what-is-the-difference-between-numpy-linalg-lstsq-and-scipy-linalg-lstsq

According to docs, numpy should only be preferred if Fortran dependency is
not desired:https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/faq.html#why-both-numpy-linalg-and-scipy-linalg-what-s-the-difference
-> should not really be relevant in modern distributions, but
since we have scipy dependency anyway, use this as might be faster
 on some systems where numpy is compiled without Fortran libs

### optimizing/ choosing engine
 
Finally, according to scipy docs, the Lapack routine can be tuned:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lstsq.html#scipy.linalg.lstsq
lapack_driver=None: str, optional
Which LAPACK driver is used to solve the least-squares problem.
Options are 'gelsd', 'gelsy', 'gelss'. Default ('gelsd') is a good choice.
However, 'gelsy' can be slightly faster on many problems. 'gelss' was used
historically. It is generally slow but uses less memory.
 (New in version 0.17.0.)

scipy.linalg.lstsq with lapack_driver = None / gelsd (default)
_buildRedAtAinvAt6.59s (NB: function changed and renamed)

scipy.linalg.lstsq with lapack_driver = gelss (historic, should not use)
_buildRedAtAinvAt1.68s

scipy.linalg.lstsq with lapack_driver = gelsy
_buildRedAtAinvAt0.45s

-> major improvement using gelsy driver!
difference in resulting test phase map on the 1e-16 (1e-10um) level, negligible
