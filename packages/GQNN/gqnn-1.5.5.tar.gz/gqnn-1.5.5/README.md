GQNN is a pioneering Python library designed for research and experimentation with Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). By integrating principles of quantum computing with classical neural network architectures, GQNN enables researchers to explore hybrid models that leverage the computational advantages of quantum systems. This library was developed by **GokulRaj S** as part of his research on Customized Quantum Neural Networks.

## Introduction

Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) are an emerging field of study combining the principles of quantum mechanics with artificial intelligence. The **GQNN** package offers a platform to implement and study hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical machine learning applications.

This package allows you to:

- Experiment with QNN architectures.
- Train models on classical or quantum data.
- Explore quantum-enhanced learning algorithms.
- Conduct research in Quantum Machine Learning.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid Neural Networks**: Combines classical and quantum layers seamlessly.
- **Custom Quantum Circuits**: Design and implement your own quantum gates and circuits.
- **Lightweight and Flexible**: Built with Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn for simplicity and extensibility.
- **Scalable**: Easily scale models for larger qubit configurations or datasets.
- **Research-Oriented**: Ideal for academic and experimental use in quantum machine learning.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 to 3.12 higher or lower version is not supported
- Ensure pip is updated: `pip install --upgrade pip`

### Installing GQNN
#### From PyPI
```bash
pip install GQNN
```

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokulraj0906/GQNN.git
cd GQNN
pip install .
```

## Getting Started

### Basic Example
```python
from GQNN.data.dataset import Data_Read
from GQNN.models.data_split import DataSplitter
from GQNN.models.Linear_model import QuantumClassifier_EstimatorQNN
import numpy as np

# Path to the dataset
data_dir = 'Employee_Salary_Dataset.csv'

# Read and preprocess the dataset
df = Data_Read.Read_csv(data_dir)
print("Original DataFrame (after reading and cleaning):")
print(df.head())

# Apply one-hot encoding to string columns
df_with_encoded_columns = Data_Read.convert_strings_to_numeric()
print("\nDataFrame after One-Hot Encoding of string columns:")
print(df_with_encoded_columns.head())

# Scale the dataset using Min-Max Scaling
scaled_df = Data_Read.Scale_data(method='minmax')
print("\nScaled DataFrame (using Min-Max Scaling):")
print(scaled_df.head())

# Split the dataset into features and target
x = df_with_encoded_columns.drop('Gender_Male', axis=1)
y = df_with_encoded_columns['Gender_Male'].astype(int)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
split = DataSplitter(x, y, test_size=0.75, shuffle=True, random_state=43)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = split.split()

# Convert data to NumPy arrays for processing
x_train = np.array(x_train)
y_train = np.array(y_train)

# Initialize and train the Quantum Neural Network model
model = QuantumClassifier_EstimatorQNN(num_qubits=4, maxiter=60, random_seed=143)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Print the trained model's parameters
model.print_model()

# Evaluate the model and compute accuracy
score = model.score(x_test, y_test)
adjusted_score = 1 - score
print(f"Model accuracy (adjusted): {adjusted_score * 100:.2f}%")
```
