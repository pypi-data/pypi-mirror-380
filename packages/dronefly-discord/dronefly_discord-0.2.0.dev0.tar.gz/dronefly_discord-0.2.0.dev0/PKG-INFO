# Dronefly Discord

This library will support writing Discord cogs based on
[dronefly-core](https://github.com/dronefly-garden/dronefly-core). It is
derived from the Discord-specific code extracted from the original
[Dronefly](https://dronefly.readthedocs.io) bot codebase. We aim to keep
the library general enough to work with any bot based on
[discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io), as well as on bots using
the [Red-DiscordBot](https://docs.discord.red) framework.
