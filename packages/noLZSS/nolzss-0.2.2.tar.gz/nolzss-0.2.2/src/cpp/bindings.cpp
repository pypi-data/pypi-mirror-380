/**
 * @file bindings.cpp
 * @brief Python bindings for the noLZSS factorization library.
 *
 * This file contains the Python bindings for the non-overlapping Lempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski
 * factorization algorithm. The bindings provide both in-memory and file-based factorization
 * capabilities with proper GIL management for performance.
 *
 * The module exposes the following functions:
 * - factorize(): Factorize in-memory text
 * - factorize_file(): Factorize text from file
 * - count_factors(): Count factors in text
 * - count_factors_file(): Count factors in file
 * - write_factors_binary_file(): Write factors to binary file
