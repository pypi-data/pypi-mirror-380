## Introduction

CrossRename is a command-line tool designed to harmonize file and directory names across Linux and Windows systems.
It ensures that your file names are compatible with both operating systems, eliminating naming conflicts
when transferring files between different environments.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Features

- Sanitizes file names to be Windows-compatible (and thus Linux-compatible)
- **NEW:** Option to replace forbidden characters with Unicode lookalikes instead of removing them
- **NEW:** Optionally renames directories to be cross-platform compatible
- Handles both individual files and entire directories
- Supports recursive renaming of files in subdirectories
- Preserves file extensions, including compound extensions like .tar.gz
- Provides informative logging
- Provides a dry-run mode to preview renaming changes without executing them
- Interactive safety warnings with option to skip for automation
- Skips recursive symlinks to avoid infinite loops

## Installation

### From PyPI (Using PIP)

```
pip install CrossRename
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Usage

```
usage: crossrename [-h] [-p PATH] [-v] [-u] [-r] [-d] [-D] [-a] [--force] [--credits]

CrossRename: Harmonize file and directory names for Linux and Windows.

options:
  -h, --help                  show this help message and exit
  -p, --path PATH             The path to the file or directory to rename.
  -v, --version               Prints out the current version and quits.
  -u, --update                Check if a new version is available.
  -r, --recursive             Rename all files in the directory path given and its subdirectories. When used with -D, also renames subdirectories.
  -d, --dry-run               Perform a dry run, logging changes without renaming.
  -D, --rename-directories    Also rename directories to be cross-platform compatible. Use with caution!
  -a, --use-alternatives      Replace forbidden characters with Unicode lookalikes instead of removing them. May cause display issues on some systems.
  --force                     Skip safety prompts (useful for automated scripts)
  --credits                   Show credits and support information
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Examples

Rename a single file:

```
crossrename -p /path/to/file.txt
```

Rename all files in a directory (and its subdirectories):

```
crossrename -p /path/to/directory -r
```

Rename all files AND directories recursively:

```
crossrename -p /path/to/directory -r -D
```

Rename a single directory:

```
crossrename -p /path/to/problematic_directory -D
```

Perform a dry run to preview renaming changes without executing them:

```
crossrename -p /path/to/directory -r -D -d
```

Skip safety prompts for automated scripts:

```
crossrename -p /path/to/directory -r -D --force
```

Use [Unicode alternatives](#unicode-alternatives-mode) instead of removing characters:
```
crossrename -p /path/to/file.txt -a
```

Check for an update:

```
crossrename -u
```

Show credits and project information:

```
crossrename --credits
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Unicode Alternatives Mode

Use `--use-alternatives` to replace forbidden characters with similar Unicode characters instead of removing them:

```bash
crossrename -p "file<name>.txt" --use-alternatives
# Result: "fileᐸnameᐳ.txt" instead of "filename.txt"
```

Character mappings:

- `<` → `ᐸ` (Canadian Syllabics Pa)
- `>` → `ᐳ` (Canadian Syllabics Po)
- `:` → `∶` (Ratio)
- `"` → `ʺ` (Modified Letter Double Prime)
- `/` → `∕` (Division Slash)
- `\` → `⧵` (Reverse Solidus Operator)
- `|` → `∣` (Divides)
- `?` → `﹖` (Small Question Mark)
- `*` → `🞱` (Bold Five Spoked Asterisk)

> [!WARNING]
>
> These Unicode characters may not display correctly on all systems, fonts, or applications.


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Safety First

> [!WARNING]  
> Always run with `--dry-run` first!

CrossRename will show interactive safety warnings before making any changes to help prevent accidental data loss.
However, it's strongly recommended to:

1. **Run a dry run first** to preview what will be changed:
   ```
   crossrename -p /your/path -r -D -d
   ```

2. **Backup your data** before running the tool on important files

3. **Use `--force` flag** for automation in CI/CD pipelines:
   ```
   crossrename -p /build/output -r -D --force
   ```

Directory renaming is particularly powerful and potentially disruptive since it changes folder paths that other
applications might reference.

## Why did I build this?

> [!WARNING]
>
> I'm no longer dual booting. I'm using Windows 11 now. I do have WSL2 and that's what I use for testing.
> I don't know if there'll be any difference in the way the tool works on a native Linux system.

So I was dual-booting Windows 10 and Lubuntu 22.04, and one day I'm trying to move some files between the two systems.
Five files just wouldn't copy over because of what I later found out were the differences in Windows and Linux's file
naming rules.

That got me thinking because I'd already built a Python package that had to deal with some file creation and renaming (
It's called [FicImage](https://github.com/Jemeni11/ficimage), please check it out 🫶) before, so I had an idea or two
about how to go about this.

Long story short, I got annoyed enough to build CrossRename. Now I don't have to deal with file naming headaches when
switching between systems.
