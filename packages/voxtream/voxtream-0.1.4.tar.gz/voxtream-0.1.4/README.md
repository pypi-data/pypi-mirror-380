We present VoXtream, a fully autoregressive, zero-shot streaming text-to-speech system for real-time use that begins speaking from the first word.

### Key featues

- **Streaming**: Support a full-stream scenario, where the full sentence is not known in advance. The model takes the text stream coming word-by-word as input and outputs an audio stream in 80ms chunks.
- **Speed**: Works **5x** times faster than real-time and achieves **102 ms** first packet latency on GPU.
- **Quality and efficiency**: With only 9k hours of training data, it matches or surpasses the quality and intelligibility of larger models or models trained on large datasets.

## Installation

```bash
pip install voxtream
```

## Usage

* Prompt audio: a file containing 3-5 seconds of the target voice. The maximum supported length is 10 seconds (longer audio will be trimmed).
* Prompt transcript: text that matches the prompt audio. The maximum supported length is 250 characters (longer text will be trimmed).
* Text: What you want the model to say. The maximum supported length is 1000 characters (longer text will be trimmed).
* **Notes**: 
    * The VoXtream requires around 2GB of VRAM.
    * Maximum generation length is limited to 1 minute.
    * The initial run may take a bit longer to download model weights.

### Command line

#### Output streaming
```bash
voxtream \
    --prompt-audio assets/audio/male.wav \
    --prompt-text "The liquor was first created as 'Brandy Milk', produced with milk, brandy and vanilla." \
    --text "In general, however, some method is then needed to evaluate each approximation." \
    --output "output_stream.wav"
```

#### Full streaming
```bash
voxtream \
    --prompt-audio assets/audio/female.wav \
    --prompt-text "Betty Cooper helps Archie with cleaning a store room, when Reggie attacks her." \
    --text "Staff do not always do enough to prevent violence." \
    --output "full_stream.wav" \
    --full-stream # This flag enables input text streaming
```

### Python API

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf

from voxtream.utils.generator import set_seed, text_generator
from voxtream.generator import SpeechGenerator, SpeechGeneratorConfig


set_seed()
with open('configs/generator.json') as f:
    config = SpeechGeneratorConfig(**json.load(f))

speech_generator = SpeechGenerator(config)

# Output streaming
speech_stream = speech_generator.generate_stream(
    prompt_text="The liquor was first created as 'Brandy Milk', produced with milk, brandy and vanilla.",
    prompt_audio_path=Path('assets/audio/male.wav'),
    text="In general, however, some method is then needed to evaluate each approximation."
)

audio_frames = [audio_frame for audio_frame, _ in speech_stream]
sf.write('output_stream.wav', np.concatenate(audio_frames), config.mimi_sr)

# Full streaming
speech_stream = speech_generator.generate_stream(
    prompt_text="Betty Cooper helps Archie with cleaning a store room, when Reggie attacks her.",
    prompt_audio_path=Path('assets/audio/female.wav'),
    text=text_generator("Staff do not always do enough to prevent violence.")
)

audio_frames = [audio_frame for audio_frame, _ in speech_stream]
sf.write('full_stream.wav', np.concatenate(audio_frames), config.mimi_sr)
```

### Gradio demo

```bash
voxtream-app
```

## Training

- Build the Docker container. If you have another version of Docker compose installed use `docker compose -f ...` instead.
```bash
docker-compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yaml build voxtream
```

- Run training using the `train.py` script. You should specify GPU IDs that will be seen inside the container, ex. `GPU_IDS=0,1`. Specify the batch size according to your GPU. The default batch size is 32 (tested on RTX3090), 64 fits into A100-40Gb, and 128 fits into A100-80Gb. The dataset will be downloaded automatically to the HF cache directory. Dataset size is 20Gb. The data will be loaded to RAM during training, make sure you can allocate ~20Gb of RAM per GPU. Results will be stored at the `./experiments` directory.

Example of running the training using 2 GPUs with batch size 32:
```bash
GPU_IDS=0,1 docker-compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yaml run voxtream python voxtream/train.py batch_size=32
```

## Benchmark

To evaluate model's real time factor (RTF) and First packet latency (FPL) run `voxtream-benchmark`. You can compile model for faster inference using `--compile` flag (note that initial compilation take some time).

| Device  | Compiled           | FPL, ms | RTF  |
| :-:     | :-:                | :-:     | :-:  |
| A100    |                    | 176     | 1.00 |
| A100    | :heavy_check_mark: | 102     | 0.17 |
| RTX3090 |                    | 205     | 1.19 |
| RTX3090 | :heavy_check_mark: | 123     | 0.19 |
