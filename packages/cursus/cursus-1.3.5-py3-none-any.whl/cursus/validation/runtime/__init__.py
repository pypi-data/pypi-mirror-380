"""
Simplified Pipeline Runtime Testing

Validates script functionality and data transfer consistency for pipeline development.
Based on validated user story: "examine the script's functionality and their data 
transfer consistency along the DAG, without worrying about the resolution of 
step-to-step or step-to-script dependencies."
