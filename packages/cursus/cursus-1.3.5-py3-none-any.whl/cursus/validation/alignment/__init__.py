Unified Alignment Tester Module

This module provides comprehensive validation of alignment rules between
scripts, contracts, specifications, and builders in the pipeline architecture.

The alignment validation covers four levels:
1. Script ↔ Contract Alignment
2. Contract ↔ Specification Alignment  
3. Specification ↔ Dependencies Alignment
4. Builder ↔ Configuration Alignment
