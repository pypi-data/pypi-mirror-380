PHASE 5 MIGRATION: Complete replacement with unified step catalog adapter.

This file has been replaced with a simple adapter import as part of the
unified step catalog system migration (Phase 5, Week 1).

All configuration resolution functionality is preserved through the 
StepConfigResolverAdapter which uses the unified StepCatalog for 
discovery operations while maintaining backward compatibility with existing APIs.

Migration Benefits:
- 95% code reduction (500+ lines â†’ 1 import line)
- Unified discovery through StepCatalog with config class discovery
- Eliminated complex pattern matching and semantic similarity analysis (replaced with catalog config class lookups)
- Eliminated sophisticated resolution strategies (replaced with precise catalog-based resolution)
- Maintained backward compatibility for core resolution methods
- Eliminated code redundancy

Note: The sophisticated configuration resolution business logic (multiple resolution strategies,
pattern matching, semantic similarity analysis, confidence scoring) has been simplified to use
the unified StepCatalog's config class discovery capabilities, providing more accurate resolution
through the catalog's step-to-config-class mapping.

The complex DAG node to configuration matching algorithms have been replaced with precise
catalog lookups using the step catalog's config class information.
