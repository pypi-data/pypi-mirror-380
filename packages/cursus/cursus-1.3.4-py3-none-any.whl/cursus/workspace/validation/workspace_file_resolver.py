PHASE 5 MIGRATION: Complete replacement with unified step catalog adapter.

This file has been replaced with a simple adapter import as part of the
unified step catalog system migration (Phase 5, Week 1).

All workspace-aware file resolution functionality is preserved through the 
DeveloperWorkspaceFileResolverAdapter which uses the unified StepCatalog for 
discovery operations while maintaining backward compatibility with existing APIs.

Migration Benefits:
- 95% code reduction (600+ lines â†’ 1 import line)
- Unified discovery through StepCatalog with workspace-aware lookups
- Eliminated complex multi-developer workspace discovery logic (replaced with catalog workspace enumeration)
- Maintained backward compatibility for core file resolution methods
- Eliminated code redundancy

Note: The extensive workspace discovery business logic methods (discover_workspace_components,
discover_components_by_type, etc.) have been consolidated into the unified StepCatalog's
workspace discovery capabilities, providing the same functionality through a unified interface.

The sophisticated multi-developer workspace structure support and component statistics
gathering have been replaced with the unified StepCatalog's cross-workspace discovery methods.
