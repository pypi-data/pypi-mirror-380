class ConnectionError(Exception):
    """
    Base exception for all connection-related errors.

    Subclasses provide more specific context, e.g. closed connections
    or invalid states. Intended for use by higher-level protocol
    handlers to unify error handling across different transports.
    """


class ConnectionClosedError(ConnectionError):
    """
    Raised when an operation is attempted on a connection that
    has already been cleanly or forcibly closed.
    """


class ConnectionNotEstablished(ConnectionError):
    """
    Raised when an operation requires an active connection but
    none has been established yet.

    Typically triggered by calling ``send_data()`` or ``recv_data()``
    before ``connect()``.
    """


class ConnectionStateError(ConnectionError):
    """
    Raised when a connection is in an invalid state for the
    requested operation.

    Examples include:
      - Attempting to connect twice without closing.
      - Attempting to reuse a connection marked invalid.
