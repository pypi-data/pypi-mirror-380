class DNP3_Master:
    """DNP3 Master (Application Layer interface).

    This class provides the master-side interface of the DNP3 protocol stack,
    built on top of the transport and link layers. It manages request/response
    exchanges with an outstation, schedules tasks, and assigns application
    sequence numbers. The master does not implement actual application logic —
    instead, it delegates handling to user-defined :class:`DNP3_Task` objects.

    This implementation supports:

    * Establishing and releasing associations with outstations.
    * Submitting tasks that generate and transmit APDUs.
    * Assigning and cycling application sequence numbers.
    * Supporting both blocking and non-blocking request patterns.
    * Optionally dispatching requests without expecting a return
      (:meth:`submit_noreturn`).

    Example::

        master = DNP3_Master(link_addr=0x0001)
        # connect to remote at 127.0.0.1:20000 with link addr 1024
        master.associate((1024, "127.0.0.1", 20000))

        # request class 1 objects
