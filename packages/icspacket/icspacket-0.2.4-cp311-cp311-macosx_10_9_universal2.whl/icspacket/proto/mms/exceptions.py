class MMSConnectionError(ConnectionError):
    """
    Raised when an MMS association or connection-related error occurs.

    This exception indicates that the remote MMS peer responded with
    an error at the connection-management level, such as during
    association setup (`M-ASSOCIATE`), release (`M-RELEASE`),
    abort (`M-U-ABORT`), or conclude (`M-CONCLUDE`).

    The contained :class:`ServiceError` provides detailed information
    about the nature of the failure as returned by the MMS peer.

    Example:
        .. code-block:: python

            try:
                mms_conn.associate(("192.168.1.100", 102))
            except MMSConnectionError as e:
                print(f"Association failed: {e.error}")

    :param error: MMS service error value returned by the peer.
    :type error: ServiceError
    :param args: Additional positional arguments passed to the base
        :class:`ConnectionError`.
    :type args: Any
    :ivar error: The MMS service error instance associated with this exception.

    Subclasses provide more specific context, such as unknown service
    requests or invalid operations.

    This exception is typically used to signal that the peer attempted

    does not support, or that is not defined in ISO 9506.

    Example:
