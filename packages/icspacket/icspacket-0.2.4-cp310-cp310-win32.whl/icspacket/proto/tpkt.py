    This class extends :class:`socket.socket` to provide automatic

    connection-oriented transport protocols. Applications can use
    :class:`tpktsock` as a drop-in replacement for raw sockets when
    working with TPKT-based communication.

    **Enhancements since 0.2.4:**

    - An internal :class:`queue.Queue` (``in_queue``) is now used to
      buffer partially received or multiple consecutive TPKT PDUs.
    - Improved handling of cases where more than one PDU arrives
      in a single TCP segment. Excess packets are queued for later
      retrieval.
    - Extended validation ensures incomplete headers are safely
      discarded and logged.
