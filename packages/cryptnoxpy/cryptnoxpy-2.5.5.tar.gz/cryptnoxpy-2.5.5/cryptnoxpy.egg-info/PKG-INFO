**Warning: This is a beta release of the software.
It is released for development purposes. 
Use at your own risk.**

A Python3 library to use the `Cryptnox smartcard applet <https://www.cryptnox.com/>`_.
It provides high level functions to send instructions to a Cryptnox Hardware Wallet Card and to manage its lifecycle. 
The core module is *CryptnoxPy* which provides a *Connection* class to 
establish a channel of communication that can be used to initialize a card instance through the 
factory method.

    pip install -U setuptools

Fedora / CentOS / RHEL

.. code-block:: bash

    yum install swig python3-pip python3-setuptools pcsc-lite-ccid
    pip install -U setuptools

On some Linux, starts PCSCd service

.. code-block:: bash

   (sudo) systemctl start pcscd
   (sudo) systemctl enable pcscd

Mac OSX

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install swig

Installation of this library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure that you installed the required packages for your system.
See the "Requires" section above.

Install with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cryptnoxpy

Install from source:

Download and run in its directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .

or:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Cryptnox-Software/cryptnoxpy.git

This might require *sudo* on some systems.

Remove:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall cryptnoxpy

Installation issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the **Linux system doesn\'t have Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 nor 3.9**\ , install
Python 3.7 with the following recipe (Debian like):

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev swig libpcsclite-dev
   sudo apt-get install -y libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm git
   sudo apt-get install -y libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev pcscd opensc
   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.8/Python-3.7.8.tgz
   tar xf Python-3.7.8.tgz
   cd Python-3.7.8
   ./configure --enable-optimizations
   make -j8 build_all
   sudo make -j8 altinstall

   sudo pip3.7 install git+ssh://git@gitlab.com/cryptnox-phase2/cryptnoxpy.git

   # or (if issue about agent forwarding with sudo) :

   cd ~
   git clone git@gitlab.com:cryptnox-phase2/cryptnoxpy.git
   cd cryptnoxpy
   sudo pip3.7 install .

In case of **pyscard can\'t be installed** automatically with pip:

 1. Try to pip3 install with sudo or root: ``sudo pip install .``
 2. If still a failure, install the following packages: Needed if pyscard can\'t be installed from package manager ``sudo apt install python3-dev swig libpcsclite-dev`` then retry ``sudo pip install .``.

If you use **contactless readers** on Linux, the RFID modules need to be disabled :

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo rmmod pn533_usb
   sudo rmmod pn533
   sudo rm -r /lib/modules/*/kernel/drivers/nfc/pn533

Update issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case you just want to update the package, with old pip version on some Linux, it is better to remove and reinstall the package:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo pip uninstall cryptnoxpy
  sudo pip install .

Library use
------------------------------------

To get the card a connection has to be established with the reader's index. The connection can
then be passed to the factory that will initialize an object for the card in the reader from the
correct class for the card type and version.

.. code-block:: python

   import cryptnoxpy

   try:
       connection = cryptnoxpy.Connection(0)
   except cryptnoxpy.ReaderException:
       print("Reader not found on index")
   else:
       try:
           card = cryptnoxpy.factory.get_card(connection)
       except cryptnoxpy.CryptnoxException as error:
           # There is an issue with loading the card
           # CryptnoxException is the base exception class for module
           print(error)
       else:
           # Card is loaded and can be used
           print(f"Card serial number: {card.serial_number}")

The factory will:

* connect to the card
* select the applet
* read the applet parameters
* select class to handle the card

The card contains basic information:

* card.serial_number : Integer : Card/applet instance Unique ID
* card.applet_version : 3 integers list : Applet version (ex. 1.2.2)

Remote connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The connection can also be initialized with a socket connection client in a list, and a True value for the 'remote' parameter.
This enables use with a remote client, communicating apdu commands over the socket connection.

.. code-block:: python

   import cryptnoxpy
   import socket

   server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   server.bind((SERVER_IP,SERVER_PORT))
   server.listen()
   conn, addr = server.accept()
   try:
       connection = cryptnoxpy.Connection(0,False,[conn],True)
   except cryptnoxpy.ReaderException:
       print("Reader not found on index")
   else:
       try:
           card = cryptnoxpy.factory.get_card(connection)
       except cryptnoxpy.CryptnoxException as error:
           # There is an issue with loading the card
           # CryptnoxException is the base exception class for module
           print(error)
       else:
           # Card is loaded and can be used
           print(f"Card serial number: {card.serial_number}")

Initialization and pairing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Right after the installation, the applet is not initialized, and the user needs
to send some parameters to use the card. The initialization can be executed once.
Any change of the base parameters requires a full applet reinstallation
(except PIN/PUK change).

After the initialization, the card and the PC must share a common secret to be
used as authenticated secure channel. This secret is required any time further,
to communicate with the card (using a secure channel). The registration of this
common secret is done during the init phase.

The init parameters required are :


* Name  (up to 20 chars string)
* Email (up to 60 chars string)
* PIN (9 digits string)
* PUK (15 digits string)
* optional : the first Paring Secret (32 bytes bytearray)

.. code-block:: python

    pairing_key = card.init(name, email, pin, puk, pairing_secret)

The returned data is the first PairingKey (32 bytes byte-array) and its index (0) :
``0x00 + ParingKeySlot0``

During the initialization phase, until the user public key for authentication
registration is allowed, the set_pairing_key command is also allowed.
Then set_pairing_key needs the applet to have the signature unlocked.

After getting the pairing_key, the user needs to store it in a safe place.
In the case the client would communicate with several cards, the user needs to
associate the pairing_key with the instance serial number of the card, so that the user
client can keep track of multiple cards, and use the right one with the right
card. The pairing_key must be saved in a file to reconnect the next time to this
card. It should be saved with the serial number of card in order to associate this card with this
key.

A common hardcoded PairingKey can be used.

After this init phase, the secure channel must be used with all communications
with the card. A secure channel is an encrypted and 2-ways authenticated link
layer with the card using standards APDU messages. Many applet commands require
a secure channel.

PIN
^^^

The PIN chosen during the initialization needs to be provided after each card
reset, and a secure channel is opened.

To test a PIN string, simply use:

.. code-block:: python

    card.verify_pin(pin)

Seed administration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The applet manages a 256 bits master secret called the "seed". This is the BIP32
Master Seed, and can be externally computed from a mnemonic to a binary seed
using BIP39. The key pairs used for ECDSA are then computationally derived from
this seed using BIP32 derivation scheme.

Seed generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The seed can be generated in the card using the random number generator in the
java chip system (AIS 20 class DRG.3). Doing this way, the seed secret never
escapes the card protection.

The method to generate a new seed key is:

.. code-block:: python

    card.generate_seed(pin)

The card can also randomly generate BIP39 mnemonics words list. But in this
case, the query answer is only output and not used internally by the card.
It is administrator responsibility to get a mnemonic using the GENERATE MNEMONIC
command and then eventually compute the corresponding seed, which can be
uploaded in the card using RECOVER KEY command.
We don't recommend doing so, this is very insecure, as the seed is exposed in
clear and full in the user's system.

Recovery
~~~~~~~~

The Cryptnox applet can load binary seed.

The seed is loaded in the card using this method:

.. code-block:: python

    card.load_seed(seed, pin)

Seed is 32 bytes.

Once this seed is loaded in the card using the load_seed method, this card now
behaves like were (or the one) it was backup. Be aware that key derivation
paths are not backup, and must be identical to retrieve the same key pairs.
See derivation and key system just below for more details.

For more details about the recovery, see load_seed operation in the API documentation.

Derivation and keys system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The card applet is fully compliant with
`BIP32 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki>`_,
except the maximum depth of derivation from the master key is 8 levels.
It can be turned on for the card to return extended public keys for use in applications
requiring it.

The card stores the present key pair (and its parent), used for signature.
This can be changed using the derive method, and also during a signature
command, giving a relative path (from the present key pair), or in an absolute path
(from the master key pair). See derive method in the API documentation.

Any derivation aborts any opened signing sessions and resets the authentications
for signature. The generated key is used for all subsequent sign sessions.

The ability to start derivation from the parent keys allows to more efficiently
switch between children of the same key. Note however that only the immediate
parent of the current key is cached so one cannot use this to go back in the
keys hierarchy.

For ease of use, the user can derive from the root master node key pair
(absolute path) at each card startup, or even before each signature.
This takes a couple of seconds. So this is better to store intermediate public
keys hash and check the status to observe the current key pair in use.
This off-card complex key management is not needed if the signatures volume
is below one thousand per day.

See derive and sign methods in the API documentation.

EC Signature
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The derivation of the key pair node can be also possible using the signature
command (relative or absolute).

The card applet can sign any 256 bits hash provided, using ECDSA with 256k1 EC
parameters. Most of the blockchain system used SHA2-256 to hash the message,
but this card applet is agnostic from this point, since the signature is performed on
a hash provided by the user. Note that this hash needs to be confirmed by the
users beforehand, when they provide their EC384 signature of this hash.

The code to sign with the EC current key node is:

.. code-block:: python

    signature = card.sign(data_hash, cryptnoxpy.Derivation.CURRENT_KEY)

data_hash is a byte-array containing the EC hash to sign using ECDSA ecp256k1:

The signature a byte array, encoded as an ASN1 DER sequence of two INTEGER values, r and s.

See the sign method in the API documentation for more information.
