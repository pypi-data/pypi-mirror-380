# rcabench-platform

An experiment framework for Root Cause Analysis (RCA), supporting fast development of RCA algorithms and their evaluation on various datasets.

## Installation

To add this package to another uv-managed project:

```bash
# Install basic package
uv add rcabench-platform

# Install with dataset analysis functionality
uv add "rcabench-platform[analysis]"
```

The `analysis` extra includes additional dependencies like `graphviz` and `matplotlib` needed for the dataset analysis features.
