Overview
--------

PLASTRO provides tools for:

* **Simulating cellular plasticity** through random walks and cluster switches
* **Analyzing phenotypic transitions** in single-cell datasets  
* **Computing plasticity overlap scores** from lineage tracing data
* **Constructing phylogenetic trees** from single-cell data

Key Features
------------

ðŸ”¬ **Plasticity Simulation**
   Multiple methods for simulating cellular plasticity including random walk plasticity and discrete cluster switches.

ðŸ§¬ **Lineage Tracing Integration**
   Full integration with CRISPR-based lineage tracing data and Cassiopeia trees.

ðŸ“Š **PLASTRO Score**
   Novel overlap-based metric for quantifying cellular plasticity from combined lineage and phenotypic data.

ðŸŒ³ **Phylogenetic Analysis**
   Neighbor-joining tree construction and phylogenetic distance calculations.

ðŸ“ˆ **Comprehensive Analysis**
   Distance metrics, archetype analysis, and visualization tools for plasticity research.

Quick Start
-----------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install PLASTRO using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install plastro

Or using conda:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge plastro

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   import plastro
   import scanpy as sc
   
   # Load your single-cell data
   adata = sc.read_h5ad('your_data.h5ad')
   
   # Simulate random walk plasticity
   walk_params = {100: 0.1, 500: 0.05, 1000: 0.02}
   plastic_adata = plastro.random_walk_plasticity(adata, walk_params)
   
   # Compute PLASTRO scores (if you have lineage data)
   plastro_scores = plastro.PLASTRO_score(character_matrix, adata)
