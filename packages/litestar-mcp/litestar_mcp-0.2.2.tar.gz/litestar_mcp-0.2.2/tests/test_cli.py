    Note: Most CLI tests need to be refactored to work with Litestar's CLI plugin system.

    Litestar CLI integration pattern. See litestar/tests/unit/test_cli/test_cli_plugin.py

    The CLI plugin integration is correctly implemented - this test verifies the help
    command works, demonstrating that the plugin registration is functional.
