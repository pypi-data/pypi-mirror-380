class FlopsMicroBenchmark(MicroBenchmark):
    """
    Base class for benchmark that checks speed of a certain type of floating point operation.

    This is set up as follows:
      - we configure the benchmark with a 'size' and a function 'f'
      - we prepare the inputs: 2 1D numpy arrays of size 'size': in_f1, in_f2
         - initialized as random floating point numbers in range [0, 10]
      - we prepare the output arrays: of size 'size': out_f, out_i
         - 1 output array per type of result: float, int
         - initialized with zeros
      - the function f will loop over a&b and write the result to c
         - the function should be implemented such that it does not use vectorized operations, we want to avoid
             using vectorized CPU instructions (AVX, etc...): we want to measure the speed of the regular, scalar
             operations
         - we numba.jit the function, to make sure it is compiled to machine code, to avoid Python overhead to dominate
             the benchmark
         - 'size' should be chosen large enough to avoid the overhead of the benchmarking framework to be noticeable
         - 'size' should be chosen small enough to fit in the CPU cache, to avoid being RAM-bandwidth limited

    Despite all these measures, it is not expected that the benchmark will be fully accurate in absolute terms.
    In real-life the speed of execution of floating point operations on a CPU will also be influenced by branching,
    memory access patterns, etc...
    The main goal is to find a reasonably accurate estimate of the relative cost of the main types of floating point
    operations, so we can make representative estimates of the number of FLOPS executed by instrumented algorithms.
