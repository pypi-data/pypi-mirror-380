"""Simulation code to simulate a SPECTRE observation.

This code simulates a SPECTRE observation, from the target on the sky, all
the way to the detector. We use other smaller simulators to simulate common
things (like the object itself or the atmosphere) and the specifics of their
implementations can be found there. Implementation specifics to the SPECTRE
instrument itself are found here.

By self-imposed convention, the attributes are generally named as `at_[stage]`
where the result is the simulated result right after simulating whichever
stage is named.

For ease, we package the smaller simulators within this single simulator class.

        creation of three different inner simulator classes. This convenience
        function does that for the user, as long as they provide the
        environmental parameters for all three.

        We assume a blackbody simulated target, an Earth-like atmosphere, and
        the IRTF telescope. The parameters modify just the specifics. For a
        more detailed approach, please construct the classes instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        channel : str
            The name of the channel that will be simulated; one of three
            channels: visible, nearir, and midir.
        wavelength : ndarray
            The wavelength basis of the simulator; this defines the wavelength
            axis and are its values.
        blackbody_temperature : float
            The blackbody temperature of the object that we are simulating,
            in Kelvin.
        magnitude : float
            The simulated magnitude of the object. The photometric filter
            system this magnitude is in must match the inputted photometric
            filter.
        photometric_filter : PhotometricABFilter or PhotometricVegaFilter
            The photometric filter (system) that the inputted magnitude is in.
        exposure_time : float
            The exposure time of the observation integration, in seconds.
        coadds : int
            The number of co-adds of the provided exposure time for the
            observation.
        spatial_shape : tuple
            The spatial shape of the simulation array, the units are in pixels.
            This parameter should not be confused with the field of view
            parameter.
        field_of_view : tuple
            A tuple describing the field of view of the spatial area of the
            simulation array, the units are in radians. We suggest oversizing
            this a little more than the traditional 7.2 by 7.2 arcseconds.
        spectral_scale : float
            The spectral scale of the simulated spectra, as a resolution,
            in wavelength separation (in meters) per pixel.
        atmosphere_temperature : float
            The temperature of the intervening atmosphere, in Kelvin.
        atmosphere_pressure : float
            The pressure of the intervening atmosphere, in Pascal.
        atmosphere_ppw : float
            The partial pressure of water in the atmosphere, in Pascal.
        atmosphere_pwv : float
            The precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere, in meters.
        atmosphere_seeing : float
            The seeing of the atmosphere, given as the FWHM of the seeing disk,
            often approximated as a Gaussian distribution, at zenith and at
            the reference wavelength. The units are in radians.
        zenith_angle : float
            The zenith angle of the simulated object, at the reference
            wavelength in radians; primarily used to determine airmass.
        parallactic_angle : float
            The parallactic angle of the simulated object, in radians; primarily
            used to atmospheric dispersion direction.
        reference_wavelength : float
            The reference wavelength which defines the seeing and zenith angle
            parameters. Assumed to be in the same units as the provided
            wavelength axis.
        telescope_temperature : float
            The local temperature of the telescope, usually the temperatures
            of the primary and other mirrors; in Kelvin.
        transmission_generator : AtmosphereSpectrumGenerator, default = None
            The transmission spectrum generator used to generate the
            specific transmission spectra. If None, we default to the built-in
            generators.
        radiance_generator : AtmosphereSpectrumGenerator, default = None
            The transmission spectrum generator used to generate the
            specific transmission spectra. If None, we default to the built-in
            generators.
