"""Function wrappers.

We borrow a lot of functions from different packages; however, for a lot of
them, we build wrappers around them to better integrate them into our
package provided its own idiosyncrasies. Moreover, a lot of these wrapper
functions are either legacy or depreciated or otherwise overly-complex; and
as such, they may be changed in future builds so we unify all changes.
