Atmospheric Properties

    For most
    cases the plane-parallel atmosphere method works, and it is what this
    function uses. However, we also use a more accurate formula for airmass at
    higher zenith angles (>80 degree), namely from DOI:10.1364/AO.28.004735.
    We use a weighted average between 75 < z < 80 degrees to allow for a
    smooth transition.
