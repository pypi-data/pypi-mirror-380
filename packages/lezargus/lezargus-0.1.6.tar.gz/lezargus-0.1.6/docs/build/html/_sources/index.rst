===========================
IRTF Lezargus Documentation
===========================

Hello

.. note::
    This documentation comes in two forms, a set of HTML webpages and a LaTeX 
    PDF document. The HTML is given preference when formatting issues arise 
    between the two. We highly suggest that you read the 
    `HTML version <https://psmd-iberutaru.github.io/Lezargus>`_ as it is 
    better formatted, easier to navigate, and more likely to be up to date.

.. _home-code-manual:

Code Manual
===========

The code manual is primarily for software maintainers and other IRTF staff. It 
details the software API documentation of Lezargus and its inner workings.
This does not detail any of the design principles of the software but instead 
it is the function and class documentation of the software (generated by Sphinx).

`Code coverage`_ is available in html. The code manual (and overall 
documentation) is generated via Sphinx and the code coverage is generated by 
a different tool. As such, it is manually linked rather than integrated.
