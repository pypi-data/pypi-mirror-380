All PSG files are generated from the NASA Planetary Spectrum Generator web interface:

PSG Models made by Adwin Boogert.

We generated atmospheric transmission and emission/radiance values for simulating SPECTRE observations.
The file format for the data is as follows:

psg_cfg_telluric_za{1}_h2o{2}pwv_0p3-4p2um.cfg
psg_cfg_telluric_za{1}_h2o{2}pwv_0p3-4p2um_{3}.txt

Parameter legend:

{1} - The zenith angle number, in degrees. Current generation is normally 0, 30, 45, and 60 degrees.
{2} - The precipitable water vapor (PWV), in millimeters, formatted as #p# for a value of #.#. 
      For example, 1p0 is 1.0 mm PWV. Current generation is 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mm PWV.
{3} - The mode of the data; either "trn" for transmission or "rad" for radiance. 

The configuration files which are used to generate these files can be found in the corresponding .cfg files.

These files are used to build the interpolator for atmospheric spectra.



The output files are structured as, see the parameter legend: psg_telluric_za{1}_{3}.txt

We have the PWV incorperated into the data file. A small header is provided.
The wavelength is in `m`, the precipitable water vapor (PWV) is in `mm` and 
the PSG radiance is in `W m^-2 sr^-1 m^-1` while the transmission is dimensionless `1`.
