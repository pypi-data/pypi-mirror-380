        Hmmmm... Changes Made, There Were
        --------------------------------

        Authentication system, improved we have, yes, hmmm.

        Hmmmm... Tests Written, Have Been
        -------------------------------
        - Coverage of 98%, achieved we have, yes, hmmm
        - Load testing, performed it was
        - With many concurrent requests, verified it is

        Hmmmm... Security Findings, Found There Are
        ----------------------------------
        - Against brute force attacks, protected now we are
        - DoS attempts, resist we now can, yes, hmmm

        Hmmmm... Configuration Changes, Required Should Be
