## Overview

These Architecture Decision Records document the key design choices made in the AIPR project. Each ADR explains the context, decision, rationale, and consequences of significant architectural choices.

## Quick Reference

### Core Architecture Decisions

**Provider Architecture (ADR-001)**
- Function-based provider pattern with central routing
- Model aliasing for improved UX
- Environment-based configuration

**Prompt System (ADR-002)**
- XML format for templates
- Placeholder-based content injection
- Support for custom prompts

**Git Integration (ADR-003)**
- GitPython library over subprocess calls
- Smart change detection logic
- Commit range analysis support
- Robust error handling

**Security Scanning (ADR-004)**
- Trivy integration for vulnerability analysis
- Optional feature with zero impact when disabled
- Automatic project type detection

**CLI Architecture (ADR-005)**
- Subcommand-based design (`pr`, `commit`)
- Global flags with consistent behavior
- Commit range functionality (`--from`, `--to`)
- Comprehensive argument validation

## Contributing

When adding new ADRs:
1. Use the next sequential number
2. Follow the established format
3. Update this index
4. Status should be: Draft → Proposed → Accepted/Rejected
5. Include implementation examples where relevant
