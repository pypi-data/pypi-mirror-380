    <purpose>
        Generate a conventional commit message (1-3 lines) from git changes.
        Follow the conventional commit format: type(scope): description
        Add additional detail lines when changes are substantial or complex.
        CRITICALLY ANALYZE the actual code changes in the diff to understand what was specifically implemented.
    </purpose>

    <analysis-strategy>
        <step>1. Examine the diff content for new functions, classes, methods, and imports</step>
        <step>2. Assess change scope: single feature vs. multiple features/areas</step>
        <step>3. For single features: identify the PRIMARY purpose and implementation details</step>
        <step>4. For commit ranges: identify multiple features and summarize the overall scope</step>
        <step>5. Look for specific patterns: error handling, new APIs, data structures, algorithms</step>
        <step>6. Generate a description that reflects the appropriate level of detail for the scope</step>
    </analysis-strategy>

    <range-analysis>
        <detect-scope>
            <small-change>Few files (1-5), focused functionality → single-feature analysis</small-change>
            <medium-change>Multiple files (6-15), related changes → enhanced feature analysis</medium-change>
            <large-change>Many files (15+), diverse changes → multi-feature range analysis</large-change>
        </detect-scope>
        <multi-feature-strategy>
            <step>1. Identify distinct functional areas or features being added/modified</step>
            <step>2. Determine the most significant or recent feature as the primary type</step>
            <step>3. Summarize secondary features in additional lines</step>
            <step>4. Focus on what was accomplished across the range, not individual commits</step>

    <instructions>
        <always>Output a conventional commit message with 1-3 lines providing appropriate detail</always>
        <always>First line: type(scope): brief description (under 72 characters)</always>
        <always>Analyze the scope of changes: single feature vs. multiple features/areas</always>
        <always>For large ranges: summarize multiple features instead of focusing on one</always>
        <always>Add 1-2 additional lines when changes are substantial or affect multiple areas</always>
        <always>Analyze actual code changes to determine what was specifically implemented</always>
        <always>Use imperative mood in the description (add, implement, create - not adds, implements)</always>
        <always>Be specific about what functionality was added (not generic "add functionality")</always>
        <always>Extract meaningful details from function names, class names, and logic</always>
        <always>Use lowercase for the first letter of description</always>
        <always>No trailing periods in any line</always>
        <always>Keep additional lines under 80 characters each</always>
        <never>Do not use generic descriptions like "add new functionality"</never>
        <never>Do not use past tense (added, fixed) or present continuous (adding, fixing)</never>
        <never>Do not add emojis or special characters</never>
        <never>Do not exceed 3 lines total</never>
        <never>Do not include explanatory text or reasoning outside the commit message</never>
        <never>For large ranges: do not focus solely on one feature when multiple exist</never>

    <scope-guidelines>
        <guideline>Extract scope from the main area of change (module, component, service)</guideline>
        <guideline>Use directory names or functional areas (auth, api, cli, parser, etc.)</guideline>
        <guideline>Scope is optional - omit if change affects multiple areas or is global</guideline>
        <guideline>Keep scope short and meaningful (max 10 characters)</guideline>

    <multi-line-guidelines>
        <single-line>Use single line for simple changes (single file, obvious functionality)</single-line>
        <two-lines>Use two lines when adding detail improves understanding of the change</two-lines>
        <three-lines>Use three lines for complex changes affecting multiple areas or components</three-lines>
        <guideline>Additional lines should provide specific implementation details</guideline>
        <guideline>Focus on what was implemented, not why or how it works</guideline>
        <guideline>Each additional line should add meaningful information</guideline>
