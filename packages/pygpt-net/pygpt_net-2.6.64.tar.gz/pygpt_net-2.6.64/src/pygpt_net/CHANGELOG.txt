When uploading large files, such indexing might take a while - therefore, if you are using the `Full context` option, which does not use the index, you can disable the `Auto-index` option to speed up the upload of the attachment. In this case, it will only be indexed when the `RAG` option is called for the first time, and until then, attachment will be available in the form of `Full context` and `Summary`.
