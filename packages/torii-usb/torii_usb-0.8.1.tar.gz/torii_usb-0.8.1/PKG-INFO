# Torii-USB

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please see the Torii-USB to SOL [migration guide] for information on migrating from SOL
> to Torii-USB.

Torii-USB is a fork of the [Luna] USB platform for [Amaranth], it was ported to [Torii] originally under the name [SOL] where it retained all of the platform and SoC machinery.

Later it was broken out into Torii-USB which is just purely the USB gateware, all of the hardware and SoC support has been retained by [SOL], but breaking it out into it's own dedicated library allows for isolating dependencies as needed.

## Installation

Please see the [installation instructions] on the [online documentation]
