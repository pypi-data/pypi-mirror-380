    New background ``dhcp ping`` test was added. This new test runs simple bash
    script in the guest VM and sends DHCP request periodically to make sure DHCP
    server replies with the IP address offered.
    The ``dhcp ping`` background test requires ``nmap`` to be installed in the
    guest VM.
