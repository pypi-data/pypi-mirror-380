    The config parameter `image_file` is not available anymore.
    With this parameter, it was possible to configure the local path to the
    images that could be used to create either Cirros or Ubuntu VM instances.
    It is still possible to do this, using the existing parameter `image_url`:

    .. code-block:: text

      [cirros]
      image_url=file:///tmp/cirros.img

    Internally, the `image_file` attribute is still part of the `UrlGlanceImageFixture` class
    and it indicates where the image file is saved locally.
