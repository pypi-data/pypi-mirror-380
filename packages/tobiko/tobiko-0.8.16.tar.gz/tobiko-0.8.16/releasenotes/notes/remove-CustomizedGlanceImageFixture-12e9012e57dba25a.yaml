    CustomizedGlanceImageFixture class is not supported anymore.
    This means the Ubuntu image provided via tobiko.conf, which could be customized during test execution in previous tobiko versions,
    has to include all the expected customizations.
    When using the tobiko ansible roles, the tobiko-download-images roles performes the required customizations by default.
    The URL to download an image without any customizations and the command that are executed during the opendev jobs can be found here:
    https://opendev.org/x/tobiko/src/commit/eb83ebe860dfb4206b346a822675c01f8ba82ccf/roles/tobiko-common/defaults/main.yaml#L62

    Due to the deprecation of the CustomizedGlanceImageFixture class, some configuration parameters have been deprecated at image level.

    * `interface_name` is not supported anymore because tobiko does not need to create a VLAN over that interface (the customized image already includes it).
    * `customized_image_provided` boolean is not supported anymore because the provided images were previously customized.
