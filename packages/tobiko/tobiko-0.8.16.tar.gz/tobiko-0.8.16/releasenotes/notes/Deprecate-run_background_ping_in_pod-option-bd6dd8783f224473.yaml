deprecations:
  - |
    Config option ``run_background_ping_in_pod`` is deprecated. New option
    ``run_background_services_in_pod`` should be used instead. This option will
    be related not only to the ``ping`` command, as it is now, but also to other
    services, like e.g. ``iperf3`` for which support will be added in the
    future.
