    Tobiko roles can customize guest images before test execution

    CI jobs using tobiko ansible roles have three options to use customized guest images:

    * The new default behavior is that the Tobiko ansible roles will customize the Ubuntu guest images before test execution. The command to customize the image can be modified overriding ``download_images.ubuntu-customized.customize_command_pattern``
    * If ``download_images.ubuntu-customized.customized`` is overriden and set to true, the image from the provided URL will not be customized. It is expected that the provided image is already customized
    * The legacy behavior, to customize Ubuntu images during test execution, can be applied by removing the default definition from ``download_images.ubuntu-customized.customize_command_pattern`` and setting ``download_images.ubuntu-customized.customized`` to false. This option will not be available in next Tobiko releases.
