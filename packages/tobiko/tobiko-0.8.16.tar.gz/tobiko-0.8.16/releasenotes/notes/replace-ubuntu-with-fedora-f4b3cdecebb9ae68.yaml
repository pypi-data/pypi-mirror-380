    From this release onwards, tobiko will use by default Fedora as guest images.
    The tobiko-download ansible role downloads a Fedora image and customizes it, by default.
    The tobiko tests will find that image in a local disk and upload it to glance.
    The resource names (images, VM instances, etc)  do not include "Fedora", but "Advanced" images or VMs.
    The test names and test class names using these Advanced images usually include the string "Advanced" too.
    The `[ubuntu]` section from the tobiko.conf file is replaced with the `[advanced_vm]` section.
    If the tobiko ansible roles are not used, an already customized image can be configured in tobiko.conf

    .. code-block:: text

      [advanced_vm]
      image_url=file:///tmp/fedora-customized.qcow2 # or https://file-server.com/fedora-customized.qcow2
