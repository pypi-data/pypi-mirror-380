    New background ``dns ping`` test was added. This new test runs simple bash
    script in the guest VM and periodically tries to resolve hostname of the
    other VM from the same stack to make sure that DNS service works properly.
    The ``dns ping`` background test requires ``resolvectl`` to be installed in
    the guest VM.
