Enable UV
=========

UV is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust.
When enabled, pip-compile-multi will use uv's dependency resolver instead of pip-tools.

.. code-block:: text

    --uv / --no-uv      Use uv for dependency resolution.

In configuration file, use ``uv`` option::

    [requirements]
    uv = True

Key differences between uv and pip-tools output:

1. UV is significantly faster at dependency resolution.
   Particularly noticeable in large projects with complex dependency trees.
2. UV's resolver is more aggressive at finding newer versions.

To use UV:

- Install ``uv`` (``pip install uv``)
- Pass ``--uv`` flag to ``pip-compile-multi``
  or add ``uv = True`` when using ``requirements`` command.
