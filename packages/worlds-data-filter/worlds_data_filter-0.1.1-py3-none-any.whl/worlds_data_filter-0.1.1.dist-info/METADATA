        litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
        lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
        constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
        licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of
        the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
        Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in

        notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
        one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
        the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
        along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
        Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
        The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not
        modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
        Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
        distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a
        whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
        complies with the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
        Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
        additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
        shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
        have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
        trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
        required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work
        and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
        writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
        Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
        KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
        or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

        tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
        applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
        writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
        direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
        character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
        to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
        commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
        the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
        or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
        acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
        and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
        obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
        responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
        to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
        accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# The Worldâ€™s Data Filterâ„¢ â€” find the most valuable data, first.

**Surface your highest-value records with *information gain*, *novelty*, and *quality* scoring.**  
A universal SDK + CLI that ranks and subsets **text, JSONL, CSV, logs, and mixed corpora** so you see the signal first.  
Built on submodular selection (facility location), stable embeddings, diversity, and fast heuristics.

> Company: **The Worldâ€™s Data Company** â€¢ Product: **The Worldâ€™s Data Filterâ„¢**

---

## âœ¨ What it does

- **Universal features** â€” pluggable extractors for text, JSON/CSV/tabular, and generic blobs.
- **Information Gain** â€” greedy **facilityâ€‘location** selection to cover the dataset with minimal redundancy.
- **Novelty** â€” distances from dataset centroid / past cache to prioritize new signal.
- **Quality filters** â€” language/length heuristics for text; null/variance checks for tabular; duplicate/similarity suppression.
- **Explainable** â€” scores per item: `coverage_gain`, `novelty`, `quality`, and a `value_score` aggregate.
- **SDK & CLI** â€” embed in Python or run as `wdf` from the terminal.
- **Deterministic** â€” stable SHAâ€‘256â€“based embeddings by default (swap for your own encoder at any time).
- **No heavy models** â€” NumPy/Scipy core; scikitâ€‘learn is optional (`[text]` extra) for TFâ€‘IDF.

> Year 2 roadmap: *The Worldâ€™s Data Index* (persistent vector/metadata store) â€” this repo stays the stateless filter/selector.

---

## ðŸš€ Quickstart (Windows / macOS / Linux)

```bash
# 1) Create a virtualenv (Python 3.10+)
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS/Linux
# source .venv/bin/activate

# 2) Install
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .[dev]            # add [text] for TF-IDF utilities if you like

# 3) Run the demo
wdf score examples/news.jsonl --text-field text --out scores.csv
wdf filter examples/news.jsonl --text-field text --k 10 --out selected.jsonl --explain
```

Outputs:
- `scores.csv` â€” perâ€‘item `coverage_gain, novelty, quality, value_score`
- `selected.jsonl` â€” the topâ€‘K items by the chosen criterion (default: `value_score`) with explanations included by default (disable via `--no-explain`)

---

## ðŸ§  How it works (high level)

### Feature extraction (adapters)
- **Text** â†’ deterministic hash embedding (384â€‘d) or optional TFâ€‘IDF.
- **JSONL/CSV** â†’ flattened key/value signals, basic stats (NA ratio, variance), and hash embedding of important string fields.
- **Generic files** â†’ filename, size, MIME guess, byte histograms (lightweight), hash embedding of content bytes.

Each item yields a vector `x_i` (unitâ€‘normalized) and auxiliary quality features.

### Scoring
- **Facility Location (coverage)**  
  \(F(S)=\sum_j \max_{i\in S} \text{sim}(x_i, x_j)\) â€” select items that best cover the rest.  
  Greedy selection approximates the optimum and doubles as a *redundancy filter*.
- **Novelty**  
  Distance from dataset centroid (or *past cache*) highlights unusual / new items.
- **Quality**  
  Text heuristics (language guess, length, printable ratio), tabular health (missingâ€‘ness, low variance), duplicate checks.

### Value score (combined)
`value_score = w_cov * coverage_gain + w_nov * novelty + w_quality * quality`  
Weights configurable in CLI/SDK.

---

## ðŸ§° CLI usage

```bash
# Score a JSONL corpus (one object per line) with a 'text' field
wdf score examples/news.jsonl --text-field text --out scores.csv

# Filter top-K by value score (explain is on by default)
wdf select examples/news.jsonl --text-field text --k 50 --out selected.jsonl

# Prefer compact JSONL (disable explanations)
wdf select examples/news.jsonl --text-field text --k 50 --out selected.jsonl --no-explain

# From a CSV (choose a text column)
wdf score examples/sample.csv --csv --text-field body --id-field id --out scores.csv

# Tune weights + disable novelty
wdf filter examples/news.jsonl --text-field text --k 20 --w-cov 0.8 --w-nov 0.0 --w-qual 0.2 --out selected.jsonl
```

**Input types supported today**
- `.jsonl` (id, text, and/or arbitrary fields)  
- `.csv` (choose columns)  
- Directory of `.txt` files (`--dir`)  
- Anything else you can adapt via a custom extractor (see `worlddatafilter/extractors/base.py`).

> You can register your own extractor in ~20 lines â€” the SDK passes through `meta` and `text` to downstream systems.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Python SDK

```python
from worlddatafilter import WorldDataFilter, loaders

docs = loaders.load_jsonl("examples/news.jsonl", text_field="text")
wdf = WorldDataFilter()
scores = wdf.score(docs)      # list of ItemScore
selected = wdf.select(docs, k=25, weights=dict(cov=0.7, nov=0.2, qual=0.1))
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Tests & Quality

```bash
ruff check .
pytest -q
```

---

## ðŸ”Œ Optional extras

- `pip install -e .[text]` â†’ scikitâ€‘learn TFâ€‘IDF utilities.
- `pip install -e .[api]`  â†’ simple FastAPI server exposing `/score` & `/filter` (coming soon).
