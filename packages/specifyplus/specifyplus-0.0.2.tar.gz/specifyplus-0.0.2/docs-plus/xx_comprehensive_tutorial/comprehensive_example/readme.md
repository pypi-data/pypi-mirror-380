All set! I’ve delivered two things:

1. **Starter repo (zip) with diagrams + PHR kit + worked iteration examples**

   * [Download the starter repo](sandbox:/mnt/data/ai-agent-playbook-starter.zip)
     Contents:
   * Minimal FastAPI app with `/healthz`
   * `docs/diagrams/*.mmd` (Mermaid stubs: context, sequence, contracts, deployment)
   * `docs/prompts/0000-template.prompt.md` (PHR template) and `scripts/` helpers
   * `.githooks/` enforcing prompt discipline (with Makefile targets)
   * `docs/TUTORIAL-ITERATIONS.md` providing comprehensive PHR examples for the first three slices
   * CI stub (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), README, Makefile

2. **Canvas doc with diagram stubs + copy-paste PHRs**
   Titled **“AI-First Playbook: Diagram Stubs & First Iterations (Comprehensive Examples)”**.
   It includes Mermaid diagram snippets and detailed PHR prompts for:

   * Iteration 1: `/healthz`
   * Iteration 2: `/chat` (non-streaming)
   * Iteration 3: `/chat` with SSE streaming + ADR prompt

If you want, I can also:

* Add **placeholder test files** for `/chat` and SSE to the zip so your first “Red” runs immediately,
* Generate a **PDF** of the canvas doc,
* Or scaffold a **Dockerfile (uv multi-stage)** and PR template prewired with ADR/PHR sections.
