## Strict Instructions

1. **Analyze the commits** to understand the changes made in this version
2. **Categorize changes** into appropriate sections:
   - **Added** for new features
   - **Changed** for changes in existing functionality
   - **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features
   - **Removed** for now removed features
   - **Fixed** for any bug fixes
   - **Security** for vulnerability fixes
3. **Write clear, user-focused descriptions** that explain:
   - What changed from a user's perspective
   - Why the change matters
   - Any important technical details
4. **Limit output to 6 bullets per section maximum** - Group similar items together or summarize when needed
   - Quality over quantity - focus on the most important changes
   - Very rarely will there need to be 6 bullets in each section; 2-4 is typical
5. **Conventions**:
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Start entries with action verbs
   - Be specific and descriptive
   - Group related changes together
   - Prioritize user-facing changes over internal refactoring
   - Include breaking changes prominently
6. **Format requirements** (CRITICAL - follow exactly):
   - Use markdown formatting
   - Use bullet points (- ) for individual changes
   - Start directly with the category sections (### Added, ### Changed, etc.)
   - Do NOT include version headers, dates, or extra sections like "### Changelog"
   - Use exactly 2 newlines between sections
   - Do NOT duplicate section headers

## Required Output Format

### Added
- Feature description 1
- Feature description 2

### Changed
- Improvement description 1
- Improvement description 2

### Fixed
- Bug fix description 1
- Bug fix description 2

## Guidelines

- Focus on changes that matter to users and developers
- Combine similar commits into coherent feature descriptions
- Omit trivial commits (typo fixes, formatting changes) unless they're significant
- Highlight breaking changes and migrations clearly
- Use technical terms appropriately for the audience
- Be concise but informative
- IMPORTANT: Never include duplicate section headers (e.g., "### Added" multiple times)
- Never include "### Changelog" sections
- Never include multiple "## [Unreleased]" sections
- Never mention commit hashes or technical Git details in the output"""
