# Brainweb-DL

Welcome to Brainweb-DL, a powerful Python toolkit for downloading and converting the Brainweb dataset.

</p>

## Features

- **Effortless Dataset Management:** Automatically download, cache, and format the Brainweb dataset with ease. Convert it to the convenient nifti format or numpy array hassle-free.

- **Multiple Image Generation:** Generate high-quality T1, T2, T2*, and PD images directly from the Brainweb dataset. Perfect for testing purposes, although keep in mind that the values provided are approximate.

### Available data 

The Brainweb project kindly provides:
 
 - A normal brain phantom (named subject `0` afterwards), with T1, T2 and PD contrasts, with a variety of noise levels and intensity non-uniformities. As well as a anatomical model (in the form of either crisp or fuzzy segmentation of brain tissues, at a fixed resolution of 181x217x181 images).
 - The same for a multiple sclerosis brain phantom (named subject `1` afterwards). 
 - A set of 20 normal brains (with ids equal to `[4, 5, 6, 18, 20, 38, 41-54]`) , with a T1 contrast (with 1mm resolution at (181, 217,181)), as well as the crisp and fuzzy segmentation of brain tissues (with a shape of (362, 434,362)) [^1].
 
This project provides a **CLI** and a **Python API** to download and convert theses data. On top of that, it can generate new contrasts (e.g. T2*) from the segmentations, and reshape the data to the desired resolution [^2].


[^1]: Note that the classification of tissue is not the same as for subject 0 and 1
[^2]: This requires scipy to be installed. 

## Get Started

### Data Location

The cached data directory follows this priority order:

1. User-specific argument (`brainweb_dir` in most functions)
2. `BRAINWEB_DIR` environment variable
3. `~/.cache/brainweb` folder

### Python Script Usage
```python
from brainweb_dl import get_mri 

# Get the phantom with id 44 with a T1 constrast 
data = get_mri(sub_id=44, contrast="T1") 
# Gt the 3rd phantomn with a fuzzy segmentation of its tissues. 
data = get_mri(sub_id="3", contrast="fuzzy") 

# Check the docstring for more information.
```

The Brainweb dataset is downloaded and cached by default in the `~/.cache/brainweb` folder.

### Command Line Interface

```bash
brainweb-dl 44 --contrast=T1
```

For more information, see `brainweb-dl --help`.

## Installation 

Get up and running quickly!

```bash 
pip install brainweb-dl
```

### Development

Join our community and contribute to Brainweb-DL!

```bash
git clone git@github.com/paquiteau/brainweb-dl 
cd brainweb-dl
pip install -e .[dev,test,doc]
```

### TODO List
Help us improve and shape the future of Brainweb-DL:

- [x] Add unit tests.
- [x] Implement fuzzy search and multiple subjects download in parallel.
- [x] Develop an interface to generate T1, T2, T2*, and PD images.
- [x] Enhance the search for the location of the Brainweb dataset (User > Environment Variable > Default Location).
- [ ] Introduce an interface to download as BIDS format.

## Acknowledgement

We extend our gratitude to the following for their contributions:

- [Casper De Clercq](https://github.com/casperdcl/brainweb/) for the preliminary work and original idea. Check out his great work if you are interested in PET imaging and registration functionalities.

- [BrainWeb](https://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/) for providing this valuable dataset to the community.
