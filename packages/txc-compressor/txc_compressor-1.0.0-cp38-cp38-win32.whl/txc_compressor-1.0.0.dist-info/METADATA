## üî¨ Technical Performance Analysis

### Computational Efficiency
Despite the dramatic compression improvements, TXC maintains exceptional speed, completing the 200MB compression in **just 12.81 seconds**‚Äîcompetitive with the fastest alternatives while delivering **substantially better compression**.

### Enterprise-Grade Reliability
Tested across datasets from 1MB to 200MB, TXC demonstrates consistent performance with:
- **Zero data loss** across all test scenarios
- **Predictable memory footprint** regardless of input size
- **Linear scaling** characteristics for enterprise deployment

### Scalable Impact
When scaled to **1TB of log data**, TXC reduces storage and network transfer needs by **~919.48 GB**, delivering significant operational efficiency and cost savings for enterprise deployments.
- Estimated monthly storage savings: **$45.97** (at $0.05/GB)

## üíº Enterprise Use Cases & ROI

TXC delivers maximum value in critical enterprise scenarios:

üè¶ **Financial Services & Log Analytics** ‚Äì Achieve up to **12√ó storage reduction** for compliance logs, enabling cost-efficient long-term retention and regulatory adherence.

üåê **CDN & Content Delivery** ‚Äì Compress logs and text-based payloads to **~42% smaller sizes** than industry-standard compressors, reducing bandwidth and accelerating content delivery.

üîç **Search Engines & Big Data** ‚Äì Enable **faster queries** and **denser compressed indices**, improving indexing efficiency and analytics performance across massive datasets.

‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Infrastructure** ‚Äì Maximize operational efficiency with **significant savings** on storage and egress costs, making large-scale log aggregation and backup more economical.

## ‚ö° Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
TXC compresses text and log files using a **token-based, dictionary-driven approach** optimized for high-density compression:

1. **Tokenization:** Splits text into words and whitespace sequences for efficient pattern recognition.
2. **Adaptive Dictionary:** Dynamically maps recurring tokens to unique integer IDs, growing the dictionary as new tokens are encountered.
3. **Entropy Compression:** Compresses the token ID stream using **Zstd**, achieving high compression ratios via statistical encoding.
4. **File Boundary Preservation:** Tracks original file boundaries to ensure accurate decompression of multiple files in a single package.

### Performance Characteristics
| Aspect | TXC | Traditional Compressors |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| **Compression Ratio** | **Best-in-class for text/logs** | Often suboptimal for text |
| **Speed** | Competitive with fastest | Tradeoff: either fast OR dense |
| **Memory Usage** | Predictable, linear in tokens | Variable by algorithm |
| **Text Optimization** | Token-aware for text/logs | General-purpose compressors


## üöÄ Quick Start Deployment

### Installation
PyPI support will be added soon. For now, install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JanBremec/txc-compressor.git
cd txc-compressor
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Basic Usage

```python 
from txc_compressor import TXCompressor

# Initialize compressor with optional dictionary file
compressor = TXCompressor(dict_path="txc_dict.bin")

# Compress multiple text files into a single package
input_files = ["log1.txt", "log2.txt"]
output_package = "compressed_package.pkl"
compressed_size = compressor.encode_files(input_files, output_package)
print(f"Compressed size: {compressed_size} bytes")

# Decompress package into output directory
output_dir = "restored_files"
restored_files = compressor.decode_package(output_package, output_dir)
print(f"Files restored: {restored_files}")
```

### Notes:
- The compressor automatically builds and updates the dictionary.
- Works with multiple files and preserves file boundaries.
- Uses Zstandard for high-speed and high-ratio compression.


## üîó Next Steps & Contributions

TXC is actively under development and will soon support:

- **PyPI distribution** for simple installation
- **Expanded platform support** for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Additional compression backends** for specialized workloads
- **Prediction table** for better compression
