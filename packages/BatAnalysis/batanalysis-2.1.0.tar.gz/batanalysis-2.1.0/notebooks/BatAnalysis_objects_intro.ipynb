    "To set information at the first level one can do `.<new_attribute>=new_value` where \\<new_attribute\\> is the variable thaat new_value will be stored under in the BatSurvey object.\n",

    "To set information in the pointing ID or source level, we would use the set method. For example: `.set_pointing_info(\"pointing ID 1\", key, value)` would create a new attribute called `key` and save the quantity stored in `value` under the specified key under \"pointing ID 1\". To set information at the source level we would, for example, do `.set_pointing_info(\"pointing ID 1\", key, value, source_id=\"source 1\")`."
