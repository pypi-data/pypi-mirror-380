"""Types for holding quantities with units.

This library provide types for holding quantities with units. The main goal is to avoid
mistakes while working with different types of quantities, for example avoiding adding
a length to a time.

It also prevents mistakes when operating between the same quantity but in different
units, like adding a power in Joules to a power in Watts without converting one of them.

Quantities store the value in a base unit, and then provide methods to get that quantity
as a particular unit. They can only be constructed using special constructors with the
form `Quantity.from_<unit>`, for example
[`Power.from_watts(10.0)`][frequenz.quantities.Power.from_watts].

Internally quantities store values as `float`s, so regular [float issues and limitations
apply](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html), although some of them are
tried to be mitigated.

Quantities are also immutable, so operations between quantities return a new instance of
the quantity.

This library provides the following types:

- [ApparentPower][frequenz.quantities.ApparentPower]: A quantity representing apparent
  power.
- [Current][frequenz.quantities.Current]: A quantity representing an electric current.
- [Energy][frequenz.quantities.Energy]: A quantity representing energy.
- [Frequency][frequenz.quantities.Frequency]: A quantity representing frequency.
- [Percentage][frequenz.quantities.Percentage]: A quantity representing a percentage.
- [Power][frequenz.quantities.Power]: A quantity representing power.
- [ReactivePower][frequenz.quantities.ReactivePower]: A quantity representing reactive
  power.
- [Temperature][frequenz.quantities.Temperature]: A quantity representing temperature.
- [Voltage][frequenz.quantities.Voltage]: A quantity representing electric voltage.

There is also the unitless [Quantity][frequenz.quantities.Quantity] class. All
quantities are subclasses of this class and it can be used as a base to create new
quantities. Using the `Quantity` class directly is discouraged, as it doesn't provide
any unit conversion methods.

Example:
    ```python
    from datetime import timedelta
    from frequenz.quantities import Power, Voltage, Current, Energy

    # Create a power quantity
    power = Power.from_watts(230.0)

    # Printing uses a unit to make the string as short as possible
    print(f"Power: {power}")  # Power: 230.0 W
    # The precision can be changed
    print(f"Power: {power:0.3}")  # Power: 230.000 W
    # The conversion methods can be used to get the value in a particular unit
    print(f"Power in MW: {power.as_megawatt()}")  # Power in MW: 0.00023 MW

    # Create a voltage quantity
    voltage = Voltage.from_volts(230.0)

    # Calculate the current
    current = power / voltage
    assert isinstance(current, Current)
    print(f"Current: {current}")  # Current: 1.0 A
    assert current.isclose(Current.from_amperes(1.0))

    # Calculate the energy
    energy = power * timedelta(hours=1)
    assert isinstance(energy, Energy)
    print(f"Energy: {energy}")  # Energy: 230.0 Wh
    print(f"Energy in kWh: {energy.as_kilowatt_hours()}") # Energy in kWh: 0.23

    # Invalid operations are not permitted
    # (when using a type hinting linter like mypy, this will be caught at linting time)
    try:
        power + voltage
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")  # Error: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Power' and 'Voltage'
    ```

This library also provides an [**experimental** module with marshmallow fields and
a base schema][frequenz.quantities.experimental.marshmallow] to serialize and
deserialize quantities using the marshmallow library. To use it, you need to make sure
to install this package with the `marshmallow` optional dependencies (e.g.
`pip install frequenz-quantities[marshmallow]`).
