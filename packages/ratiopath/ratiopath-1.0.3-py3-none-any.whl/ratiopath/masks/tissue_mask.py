    The function extracts the saturation channel from the WSI, applies Otsu thresholding to
    identify tissue regions, and performs morphological operations (closing and opening)
    to refine the mask.

    Args:
        slide: whole-slide image (WSI) pyvips file handler.
        mpp: Resolution of the mask in Âµm/px.
        filter: A VipsFilter object that defines the operations to be applied to the image.
            The default filter includes saturation channel extraction, Otsu thresholding, closing, and opening operations.
            The disk factor for morphological operations using the default filter is 10.

    Returns:
        The generated tissue mask as pyvips.Image.
