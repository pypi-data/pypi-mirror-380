# uqregressors.conformal.cqr 
This class implements split conformal quantile regression as described by [Romano et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03222)

!!! tip
    The quantiles of the underlying quantile regressor can be tuned with the parameters tau_lo and tau_hi as in the paper. This can often result in more efficient intervals.
