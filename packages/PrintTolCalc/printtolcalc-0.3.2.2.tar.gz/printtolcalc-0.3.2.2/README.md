# PrintTolCalc

(<ins>**Print**</ins> <ins>**Tol**</ins>erance <ins>**Calc**</ins>ulator)

A simple CLI tool to calculate 3D print dimensional tolerance.

It is worthy to note this is more for testing your print consistency (and lets be honest, even more-so bragging).

Testing in this way is not an end-all be-all solution,
It does have issues and is not a perfect representation of printer performance.

I realize this code "may be"(read: "is") bad but I don't care it's a sideproject for fun anyways, Don't take it too seriously!
