<i>Moonframe is an open-source Python library that helps you create interactive graphs using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> without writing a single line of JavaScript.   
It’s built for quick data exploration and aims to be as simple and accessible as possible.</i>


## Main features
### Customizable charts without coding

Moonframe provides a clear interface that handles all customization. You can easily navigate between graph views to explore your dataset.

### Interact with the data

Tooltips are available on all charts. They show details from your data when you hover over a point, and you can fully customize what they display. This can be helpful for getting quick insights. You can also highlight color groups on hover to spot trends more easily in your dataset.

An option allows you to group points that share the same colour group. As a result, when you hover over a point, all the points in the same group are shown."/></div>

### Easy to setup

Moonframe comes with a minimalist CLI: one command, one graph.
Your data just needs to be in CSV format; a widely used and simple standard in the data visualization community. You can also include Moonframe directly in any of your Python project!
