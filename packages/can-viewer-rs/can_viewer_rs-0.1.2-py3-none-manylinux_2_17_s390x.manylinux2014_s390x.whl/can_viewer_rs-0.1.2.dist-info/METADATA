A terminal-based CAN bus viewer for Linux SocketCAN written in Rust.

It is a port of my original [Python CAN viewer](https://github.com/Lauszus/python_can_viewer), which is integrated into [python-can](https://github.com/hardbyte/python-can).

## Usage

To test this application you can either install it via `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install can-viewer-rs
```

Or run pre-compiled binaries using [uvx](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uvx can-viewer-rs --channel can0
```

Some pre-compiled binaries are also available on the [Releases](https://github.com/Lauszus/can-viewer-rs/releases) page.
