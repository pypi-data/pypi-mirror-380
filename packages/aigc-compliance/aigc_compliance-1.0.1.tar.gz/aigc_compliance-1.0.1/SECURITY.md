## Reporting a Vulnerability

The AIGC Compliance team takes security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in our Python SDK, please help us maintain the security of our users by reporting it responsibly.

### 🚨 Critical Security Issues

For **critical security vulnerabilities** that could compromise user data or API security:

**📧 Email**: [security@aigc-compliance.com](mailto:security@aigc-compliance.com)

**Include in your report**:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

**⏱️ Response Timeline**:
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Fix & Release**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

#### API Key Security
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Use environment variables
import os
from aigc_compliance import ComplianceClient

api_key = os.getenv("AIGC_API_KEY")
client = ComplianceClient(api_key)

# ❌ BAD: Hardcoded API keys
client = ComplianceClient("sk_live_your_key_here")  # Never do this!
```

#### Secure File Handling
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Validate file paths
import os
from pathlib import Path

def safe_file_process(file_path: str):
    path = Path(file_path).resolve()
    if not path.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {file_path}")
    
    # Additional validation
    allowed_extensions = {'.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.gif'}
    if path.suffix.lower() not in allowed_extensions:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported file type: {path.suffix}")
    
    return client.comply(str(path))

# ❌ BAD: Direct path usage without validation
result = client.comply("../../../sensitive/file.jpg")
```

#### Network Security
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Use HTTPS and verify certificates
from aigc_compliance import ComplianceClient

client = ComplianceClient(
    api_key="your_key",
    base_url="https://api.aigc-compliance.com",  # Always HTTPS
    timeout=30  # Reasonable timeout
)

# ✅ GOOD: Handle network errors securely
try:
    result = client.comply("image.jpg")
except Exception as e:
    # Log error without exposing sensitive data
    logger.error("API request failed", extra={"error_type": type(e).__name__})
    raise  # Re-raise for handling upstream
```

### 🛡️ Security Features

#### Built-in Security Measures

1. **HTTPS Only**: All API communication uses TLS 1.2+
2. **API Key Validation**: Keys are validated before requests
3. **Request Timeouts**: Prevents hanging connections
4. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in respect for API rate limits
5. **Input Validation**: File paths and parameters are validated
6. **Error Sanitization**: Errors don't leak sensitive information

#### Authentication Security
```python
# The SDK handles secure authentication automatically
client = ComplianceClient("your_api_key")

# Internally, this becomes:
# Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
# Content-Type: multipart/form-data
# User-Agent: aigc-compliance-python-sdk/1.0.1
```

### 🔍 Vulnerability Categories

#### High Priority (Critical Response)
- **Authentication Bypass**: Circumventing API key validation
- **Data Exposure**: Unintended exposure of processed images or metadata
- **Code Injection**: Ability to execute arbitrary code
- **API Key Leakage**: Keys exposed in logs, errors, or responses

#### Medium Priority (7-day Response)  
- **Information Disclosure**: Exposing system information
- **DoS Vulnerabilities**: Ways to cause service disruption
- **Privilege Escalation**: Accessing features beyond API key scope

#### Low Priority (14-day Response)
- **Input Validation**: Missing validation on edge cases
- **Error Information**: Too much information in error messages
- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure default settings

### 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting code that handles security-sensitive operations:

- [ ] **API Keys**: Never hardcode, always use environment variables
- [ ] **File Paths**: Validate and sanitize all file path inputs
- [ ] **Network Requests**: Use HTTPS only, verify certificates
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- [ ] **Logging**: Ensure logs don't contain API keys or sensitive data
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and parameters
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Respect API rate limits to prevent abuse

### 🔧 Secure Development Practices

#### Dependency Management
```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip audit

# Update dependencies regularly
pip install --upgrade aigc-compliance
```

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# .env file (never commit this!)
AIGC_API_KEY=sk_live_your_secret_key_here
AIGC_BASE_URL=https://api.aigc-compliance.com
AIGC_TIMEOUT=30

# Load in application
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

#### Secure Testing
```python
# test_security.py
import pytest
from aigc_compliance import ComplianceClient
from aigc_compliance.exceptions import ComplianceAuthenticationError

def test_invalid_api_key():
    """Ensure invalid API keys are rejected."""
    client = ComplianceClient("invalid_key")
    with pytest.raises(ComplianceAuthenticationError):
        client.comply("test.jpg")

def test_file_validation():
    """Ensure malicious file paths are blocked."""
    client = ComplianceClient("valid_key")
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        client.comply("../../../etc/passwd")
```

### 🚨 Incident Response

If a security incident is confirmed:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-4 hours)

   - Coordinate with package managers (PyPI)

3. **Long-term Response** (1-7 days)
   - Release patched version
   - Update documentation and best practices
   - Conduct post-incident review
