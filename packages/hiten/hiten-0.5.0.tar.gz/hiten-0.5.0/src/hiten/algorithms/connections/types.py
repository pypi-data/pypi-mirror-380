"""Provide result classes for connection discovery data in CR3BP.

This module provides data structures for storing and presenting the results
of connection discovery between manifolds in the Circular Restricted Three-Body
Problem (CR3BP). It includes both individual connection result records and
collection classes with convenient access and formatting methods.

The result classes provide a clean interface for accessing connection data
including transfer types, Delta-V requirements, intersection points, and
full 6D state information at connection points.

All coordinates and velocities are in nondimensional CR3BP rotating-frame units.

class _ConnectionResult:
    """Store an individual connection result between two manifolds.

    This dataclass stores all the information about a single discovered
    connection between source and target manifolds, including the transfer
    type, velocity change requirement, geometric location, and full state
    information at the connection point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kind : {"impulsive", "ballistic"}
        Type of transfer. "ballistic" for very low Delta-V transfers
        (typically ||Delta-V|| <= ballistic_tol), "impulsive" for transfers
        requiring finite velocity changes.
    delta_v : float
        Magnitude of velocity change required for the transfer, in
        nondimensional CR3BP velocity units. ||v_source - v_target||.
    point2d : tuple of float
        2D coordinates (x, y) of the connection point on the synodic section
        plane, in nondimensional CR3BP distance units.
    state_u : np.ndarray, shape (6,)
        6D phase space state [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz] at the connection point
        on the source (typically unstable) manifold, in nondimensional
        CR3BP units.
    state_s : np.ndarray, shape (6,)
        6D phase space state [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz] at the connection point
        on the target (typically stable) manifold, in nondimensional
        CR3BP units.
    index_u : int
        Index of the connection point within the source manifold's
        section intersection data.
    index_s : int
        Index of the connection point within the target manifold's
        section intersection data.
    trajectory_index_u : int
        Index of the trajectory within the source manifold that
        produced the connection point.
    trajectory_index_s : int
        Index of the trajectory within the target manifold that
        produced the connection point.

    Notes
    -----
    ConnectionPipeline results are typically generated by the backend algorithms
    and sorted by increasing Delta-V requirement. The classification
    into "ballistic" vs "impulsive" is based on the ballistic_tol
    parameter in the search configuration.

    The 2D point coordinates correspond to the intersection location
    on the synodic section plane, while the 6D states provide the
    full phase space information needed for trajectory propagation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Accessing connection data
    >>> print(f"Transfer type: {result.kind}")
    >>> print(f"Delta-V: {result.delta_v:.6f}")
    >>> print(f"Section point: {result.point2d}")
