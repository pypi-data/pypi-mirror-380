"""Seeding strategies for synodic Poincare sections.

This module provides seeding strategy classes for synodic Poincare section
detection. Since synodic maps operate on precomputed trajectories rather
than generating initial conditions, the strategies are minimal and serve
as placeholders to satisfy the engine interface.

The main class :class:`~hiten.algorithms.poincare.synodic.strategies._NoOpStrategy` 
implements a no-operation seeding strategy that raises NotImplementedError when called, 
since synodic maps do not require seed generation.

The implementation provides a minimal interface that satisfies the
engine requirements while clearly indicating that seed generation
is not applicable for synodic maps.

    synodic Poincare maps operate on precomputed trajectories rather

    Parameters
    ----------
    map_cfg : :class:`~hiten.algorithms.poincare.synodic.config._SynodicMapConfig`
        The map configuration (unused).

    Notes
    -----
    This strategy is required by the engine interface but is not used
    in practice. Synodic Poincare maps receive precomputed trajectories
    through the engine's set_trajectories method rather than generating
    initial conditions from seeds.

    The strategy clearly indicates through NotImplementedError that
    seed generation is not applicable for synodic maps, providing
    a clear error message if the method is accidentally called.

    All time units are in nondimensional units unless otherwise specified.
