    A new state ``SKIPPED`` has been added to the Actions. Actions can reach this state
    in two situations:

    * Watcher detects a specific pre-defined condition in the `pre_condition` phase.

    * An admin sets the state to SKIPPED using a call to the new Patch API `/actions/{action_id}`
      before the action plan is started.

    An action in ``SKIPPED`` state will not be executed by Watcher as part of an ActionPlan
    run.

    Additionally, a new field ``status_message`` has been added to Audits, ActionPlans and
    Actions which will be used to provide additional details about the state of an object.

    All these changes have been introduced in a new Watcher ``API microversion 1.5``.

    For additional information, see the API reference.
