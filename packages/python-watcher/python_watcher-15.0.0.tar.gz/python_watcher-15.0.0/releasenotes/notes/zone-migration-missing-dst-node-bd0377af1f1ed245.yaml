    The zone migration strategy no longer requires a dst_node to be passed.
    When unspecified, the Nova scheduler will select an appropriate host automatically.
    This brings the implementation of the strategy in line with the the api schema
    where dest_node is optional.

    If a dst_pool is not passed, the strategy will not migrate some volumes, as Cinder can't compute a
    destination host when migrating available volumes like Nova does. If src_type and dst_type are equal,
    a migration is only performed if a dst_pool is provided, otherwise the volume will be skipped/ignored.
    If src_type and dst_type are different, the strategy will retype the volumes.
