    Currently, when Watcher applies a `volume_migrate` action with value
    `retype` for the `migratione_type`, it can wrongly report the result of
    the action when the retype does not trigger a volume migration.

    This patch fixes the logic to validate the resulting state of the action
    and reports it correctly.
