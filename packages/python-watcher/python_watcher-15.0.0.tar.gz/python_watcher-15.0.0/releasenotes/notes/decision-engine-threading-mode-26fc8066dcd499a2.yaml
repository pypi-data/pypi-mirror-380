    The Decision Engine service now supports running with ``native threading``
    mode enabled as opposed to the use of the Eventlet library.
    Note that the use of ``native threading`` is still ``experimental``,
    and is disabled by default. It should not be used in production. To
    switch from Eventlet to native threading mode, the environment variable
    ``OS_WATCHER_DISABLE_EVENTLET_PATCHING=true`` needs to be added to
    the decision engine service configuration. For more information,
    please check `eventlet removal
    <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Eventlet-removal>`__ documentation.
