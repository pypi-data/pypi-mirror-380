  The ``OpenStack 2025.2`` (``Watcher 15.0.0``) release delivers stronger security,
  granular operational control, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities for cloud
  optimization. This release strengthens the foundation for reliable, large-scale
  cloud operations while giving administrators complete flexibility in
  managing optimization workflows.

  Cloud operators gain secure and reliable volume migration processes that eliminate
  data loss scenarios and ensure tenant isolation. The Host Maintenance strategy
  now provides granular control over migration behavior, including the ability to
  disable live or cold migration and safely stop instances when migration
  cannot proceed.

  The new ``Aetos data source`` adds secure, role-based access to Prometheus metrics
  through Keystone authentication. This enables multi-tenant monitoring while
  maintaining access controls across your cloud infrastructure.

  Administrators can now exercise precise control over optimization workflows by
  manually skipping actions or allowing Watcher to automatically skip actions
  based on detected conditions. Custom status messages document why administrators
  or Watcher took specific actions, improving operational visibility and
  troubleshooting.
