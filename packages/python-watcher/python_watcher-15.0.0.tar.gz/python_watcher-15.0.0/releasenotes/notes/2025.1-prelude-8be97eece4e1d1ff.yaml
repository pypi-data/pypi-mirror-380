prelude: |
  The ``Openstack 2025.1`` (``Watcher 14.0.0``) includes several new features,
  deprecations, and removals. After a period of inactivity, the Watcher
  project moved to the Distributed leadership model in ``2025.1`` with
  several new contributors working to modernize the code base.
  Activity this cycle was mainly focused on paying down technical debt
  related to supporting newer testing runtimes. With this release,
  ``ubuntu 24.04`` is now officially tested and supported.

  ``Ubuntu 24.04`` brings a new default Python runtime ``3.12`` and with it
  improvements to eventlet and SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility where required.
  ``2025.1`` is the last release to officially support and test with ``Ubuntu 22.04``.

  ``2025.1`` is the second official skip-level upgrade release supporting
  upgrades from either ``2024.1`` or ``2024.2``

  Another area of focus in this cycle was the data sources supported by Watcher.
  The long obsolete `Ceilometer` API data source has been removed, and the untested
  `Monasca` data source has been deprecated and a new `Prometheus` data source
  has been added.

fixes:
  - https://bugs.launchpad.net/watcher/+bug/2086710 watcher compatibility between
    eventlet, apscheduler, and python 3.12
  - https://bugs.launchpad.net/watcher/+bug/2067815 refactoring of the SQLAlchemy
    database layer to improve compatibility with eventlet on newer Pythons
  - A number of linting issues were addressed with the introduction
    of pre-commit. The issues include but are not limited to, spelling and grammar
    fixes across all documentation and code, numerous sphinx documentation build warnings
    , and incorrect file permission such as files having the execute bit set when not required.
    While none of these changes should affect the runtime behavior of Watcher, they
    generally improve the maintainability and quality of the codebase.
