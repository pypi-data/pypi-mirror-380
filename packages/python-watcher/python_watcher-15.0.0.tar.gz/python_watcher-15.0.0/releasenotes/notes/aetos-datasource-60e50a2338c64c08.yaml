    A new Aetos data source is added. This allows the watcher decision
    engine to collect metrics through an Aetos reverse proxy server which
    provides multi-tenant aware access to Prometheus with Keystone
    authentication and role-based access control. The Aetos datasource
    uses Keystone service discovery to automatically locate the Aetos
    endpoint and provides enhanced security compared to direct Prometheus
    access. For more information about the Aetos data source, including
    configuration options see
