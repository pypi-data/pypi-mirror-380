    **Monasca client** dependency is now **optional**. The Monasca datasource
    remains **deprecated for removal**, and the ``python-monascaclient`` package
    is no longer installed by default. If you use the Monasca datasource,
    you **MUST** install the optional extra when upgrading.
    Behavior for deployments that do not use Monasca is unchanged.

    **Example**
    ::

      pip install watcher[monasca]
