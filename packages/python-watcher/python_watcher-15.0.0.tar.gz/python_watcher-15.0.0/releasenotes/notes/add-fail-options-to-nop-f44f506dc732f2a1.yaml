    Three new parameters have been added to the ``nop`` action:

    * ``fail_pre_condition``: When setting it to `true` the action
      fails on the pre_condition execution.

    * ``fail_execute``: When setting it to `true` the action fails
      on the execute step.

    * ``fail_post_condition``: When setting it to `true` the action
      fails on the post_condition execution.
