    Fixed action status_message update restrictions to allow updates when
    action is in SKIPPED state. Previously, users could only update the
    status_message when initially changing the action state to SKIPPED.
    Now users can update the status_message field at any time while the
    action remains in SKIPPED state, enabling them to fix typos, provide
    more detailed explanations, or expand on reasons that were initially
    omitted. For more details, see the bug report:
