    The Host Maintenance strategy now supports two new input parameters:
    ``disable_live_migration`` and ``disable_cold_migration``. These
    parameters allow cloud administrators to control whether live, cold or
    no migration should be considered during host maintenance operations.

    * If ``disable_live_migration`` is set, active instances will be cold
      migrated if ``disable_cold_migration`` is not set, otherwise active
      instances will be stopped.
    * If ``disable_cold_migration`` is set, inactive instances will not be
      cold migrated.
    * If both are set, only stop actions will be applied on active instances.

    A new `stop` action has been introduced and registered to support
    scenarios where migration is disabled.
