    The compute model was extended with additional server attributes to provide
    more detailed information about compute instances. These additions will
    enable strategies to make more precise decisions by considering more server
    placement constraints. The new attributes are ``flavor extra specs`` and
    ``pinned availability zone``. Each new attribute depends on a minimal
    microversion to be supported in nova and configured in the watcher
    configuration, at ``nova_client`` section. Please refer to the nova api-ref
    documentation for more details on which microversion is required:
    https://docs.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/
    A new configuration option was added to allow the user to enable or disable
    the extended attributes collection, which is disabled by default.
