# NOTE(licanwei): Do eventlet monkey patching here, instead of in
# common/service.py.  This allows the API service to run without monkey
# patching under Apache (which uses its own concurrency model). Mixing
# concurrency models can cause undefined behavior and potentially API timeouts.
# NOTE(sean-k-mooney) while ^ is true, since that was written asyncio was added
# to the code base in addition to apscheduler which provides native threads.
# As such we have a lot of technical debt to fix with regards to watchers
# concurrency model as we are mixing up to 3 models the same process.
# apscheduler does not technically support eventlet but it has mostly worked
# until now, apscheduler is used to provide a job schedulers which mixes
# monkey patched and non monkey patched code in the same process.
# That is problematic and can lead to errors on python 3.12+.
# The maas support added asyncio to the codebase which is unsafe to mix
# with eventlets by default.
