## üöß Under Development

This project is still in an **alpha stage**. Expect rapid changes, incomplete features, and possible breaking updates between releases. 

- The API may evolve as we stabilize core functionality.  
- Documentation and examples are incomplete.  
- Feedback and bug reports are especially valuable at this stage.

This repository contains the napari wrapper for the Flow-Registration toolbox, which is a toolbox for the compensation and stabilization of multichannel microscopy videos. 
The publication for this toolbox can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/jbio.202100330) and the project website with video results [here](https://www.snnu.uni-saarland.de/flow-registration/).

## Installation via pip and conda

To install the plugin via conda, you can create a new environment and install `napari` along with the plugin:

    conda create -n flowreg -c conda-forge python=3.12.0 napari

You can then install `napari-flowreg` via [pip]:

    pip install napari[all] napari-flowreg

or from the directly from the GitHub repository:

    pip install git+https://github.com/flowregsuite/napari-flowreg.git


## Dataset

The dataset which we used for our evaluations is available as [2-Photon Movies with Motion Artifacts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fPdzQo5SiA-62k4eHF0ZaKJDt1vmTVed?usp=sharing).
