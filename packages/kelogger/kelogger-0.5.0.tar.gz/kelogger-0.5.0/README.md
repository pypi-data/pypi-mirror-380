# Kaggle Error Logger

`kaggle_error_logger` is a lightweight Python package that automatically logs **unhandled exceptions** in Kaggle notebooks or scripts. Any uncaught error is saved to a file (`/kaggle/working/error_log.txt`) so it can be accessed by monitoring tools or for debugging purposes. This is especially useful when running long Kaggle kernels where errors might otherwise be missed.
