              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Biomni: A General-Purpose Biomedical AI Agent

## Overview


Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to autonomously execute a wide range of research tasks across diverse biomedical subfields. By integrating cutting-edge large language model (LLM) reasoning with retrieval-augmented planning and code-based execution, Biomni helps scientists dramatically enhance research productivity and generate testable hypotheses.


## Quick Start

### Installation

Our software environment is massive and we provide a single setup.sh script to setup.
Follow this [file](biomni_env/README.md) to setup the env first.

Then activate the environment E1:

```bash
conda activate biomni_e1
```

then install the biomni official pip package:

```bash
pip install biomni --upgrade
```

For the latest update, install from the github source version, or do:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni.git@main
```

Lastly, configure your API keys using one of the following methods:

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

#### Option 1: Using .env file (Recommended)

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your actual API keys
```

Your `.env` file should look like:

```env
# Required: Anthropic API Key for Claude models
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Optional: OpenAI API Key (if using OpenAI models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Azure OpenAI API Key (if using Azure OpenAI models)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_api_key
OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/

# Optional: AI Studio Gemini API Key (if using Gemini models)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: groq API Key (if using groq as model provider)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

# Optional: Set the source of your LLM for example:
#"OpenAI", "AzureOpenAI", "Anthropic", "Ollama", "Gemini", "Bedrock", "Groq", "Custom"
LLM_SOURCE=your_LLM_source_here

# Optional: AWS Bedrock Configuration (if using AWS Bedrock models)
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=your_bedrock_api_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Optional: Custom model serving configuration
# CUSTOM_MODEL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/v1
# CUSTOM_MODEL_API_KEY=your_custom_api_key_here

# Optional: Biomni data path (defaults to ./data)
# BIOMNI_DATA_PATH=/path/to/your/data

# Optional: Timeout settings (defaults to 600 seconds)
# BIOMNI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=600
```

#### Option 2: Using shell environment variables

Alternatively, configure your API keys in bash profile `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # optional if you just use Claude
export OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/" # optional unless you are using Azure
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="YOUR_BEDROCK_API_KEY" # optional for AWS Bedrock models
export AWS_REGION="us-east-1" # optional, defaults to us-east-1 for Bedrock
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" #optional if you want to use a gemini model
export GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY" # Optional: set this to use models served by Groq
export LLM_SOURCE="Groq" # Optional: set this to use models served by Groq


```
</details>


#### ⚠️ Known Package Conflicts

Some Python packages are not installed by default in the Biomni environment due to dependency conflicts. If you need these features, you must install the packages manually and may need to uncomment relevant code in the codebase. See the up-to-date list and details in [docs/known_conflicts.md](./docs/known_conflicts.md).

### Basic Usage

Once inside the environment, you can start using Biomni:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize the agent with data path, Data lake will be automatically downloaded on first run (~11GB)
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Execute biomedical tasks using natural language
agent.go("Plan a CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion, generate 32 genes that maximize the perturbation effect.")
agent.go("Perform scRNA-seq annotation at [PATH] and generate meaningful hypothesis")
agent.go("Predict ADMET properties for this compound: CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O")
```
If you plan on using Azure for your model, always prefix the model name with azure- (e.g. llm='azure-gpt-4o').

### Configuration Management

Biomni includes a centralized configuration system that provides flexible ways to manage settings. You can configure Biomni through environment variables, runtime modifications, or direct parameters.

```python
from biomni.config import default_config
from biomni.agent import A1

# RECOMMENDED: Modify global defaults for consistency
default_config.llm = "gpt-4"
default_config.timeout_seconds = 1200

# All agents AND database queries use these defaults
agent = A1()  # Everything uses gpt-4, 1200s timeout
```

**Note**: Direct parameters to `A1()` only affect that agent's reasoning, not database queries. For consistent configuration across all operations, use `default_config` or environment variables.

For detailed configuration options, see the **[Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)**.

### PDF Generation

Generate PDF reports of execution traces:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize agent
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Run your task
agent.go("Your biomedical task here")

# Save conversation history as PDF
agent.save_conversation_history("my_analysis_results.pdf")
```

**PDF Generation Dependencies:**

For optimal PDF generation, install one of these packages:

```bash
# Option 1: WeasyPrint (recommended for best layout control)
# Conda environment (recommended)
conda install weasyprint

# System installation
brew install weasyprint  # macOS
apt install weasyprint   # Linux

# See [WeasyPrint Installation Guide](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html) for detailed instructions.

# Option 2: markdown2pdf (Rust-based, fast and reliable)
# macOS:
brew install theiskaa/tap/markdown2pdf

# Windows/Linux (using Cargo):
cargo install markdown2pdf

# Or download prebuilt binaries from:
# https://github.com/theiskaa/markdown2pdf/releases/latest

# Option 3: Pandoc (pip installation)
pip install pandoc
```

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

Biomni supports MCP servers for external tool integration:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

agent = A1()
agent.add_mcp(config_path="./mcp_config.yaml")
agent.go("Find FDA active ingredient information for ibuprofen")
```

**Built-in MCP Servers:**
For usage and implementation details, see the [MCP Integration Documentation](docs/mcp_integration.md) and examples in [`tutorials/examples/add_mcp_server/`](tutorials/examples/add_mcp_server/) and [`tutorials/examples/expose_biomni_server/`](tutorials/examples/expose_biomni_server/).
