class RelatedEvent(BaseModel):
    """
    Model representing a related event.

    The RelatedEvent class encapsulates information about an event related to a security incident,
    including details such as the Cyber Kill Chain phase, MITRE ATT&CK速 details, observables,
    product identifier, event type, event type identifier, and unique identifier.

    Attributes:
    - Kill Chain (kill_chain) [Optional]: The Cyber Kill Chain速 provides a detailed description of each phase and its associated activities within the broader context of a cyberattack.
    - MITRE ATT&CK速 Details (attacks) [Optional]: An array of MITRE ATT&CK速 objects describing the tactics, techniques & sub-techniques identified by a security control or finding.
    - Observables (observables) [Optional]: The observables associated with the event or a finding.
    - Product Identifier (product_uid) [Optional]: The unique identifier of the product that reported the related event.
    - Type (type) [Optional]: The type of the related event. For example: Process Activity: Launch.
    - Type ID (type_uid) [Recommended]: The unique identifier of the related event type. For example: 100701.
    - Unique ID (uid) [Required]: The unique identifier of the related event.
