## Available Examples

- [**Example 1: Basic Spatial Analysis (Claude)**](basic_spatial_analysis_claude.md)

  - Perform buffer and intersection operations on shapefiles (e.g., park and building polygons).
  - Learn how to load shapefiles, buffer geometries, find intersections, and return results in WKT format.
  - Includes a video walkthrough.

- [**Example 2: CRS Check, Reprojection, Area & Distance Calculations**](crs_area_distance_analysis.md)

  - Check and transform the CRS of a parcel shapefile, calculate area by land use, and measure distances between centroids.
  - Useful for urban planning, cadastral management, and spatial QA.
  - Includes a video walkthrough.

- [**Example 3: Movement Analysis (OSMnx)**](movement_example.md)

  - Download and analyze street networks, calculate shortest paths between points, and visualize movement networks.
  - Useful for urban mobility, routing, and network analysis.
  - Includes a video walkthrough.

- [**Example 4: Climate Data Download & Analysis**](climate_data_example.md)

  - Download, visualize, and analyze climate raster data (e.g., Temperature) using GIS MCP Server & Claude Desktop.
  - Learn how to clip rasters, calculate zonal statistics, and export results for further analysis.
