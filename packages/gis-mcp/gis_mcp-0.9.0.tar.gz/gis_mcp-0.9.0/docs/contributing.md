# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GIS MCP Server! We welcome issues, ideas, docs, and code.

### Ways to contribute

- Report bugs and request features via GitHub Issues
- Improve documentation and examples
- Add or refine MCP tools (Shapely, PyProj, GeoPandas, Rasterio, PySAL)
- Triage issues, review PRs

### Development setup

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Create a Python 3.10+ virtual environment and install in editable mode:

```bash
pip install uv
uv venv --python=3.10
uv pip install -e .
```

3. Run the server from source:

```bash
python -m gis_mcp
```

4. Optional: integrate with your MCP client for local development
