# Get Started with Microsoft Agent Framework Workflows

Workflow capabilities ship with the core `agent-framework` package.

```bash
pip install agent-framework
```

Optional visualization support is still available via the `viz` extra:

```bash
pip install agent-framework[viz]
```

See the [project README](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/python/README.md) for more information.
