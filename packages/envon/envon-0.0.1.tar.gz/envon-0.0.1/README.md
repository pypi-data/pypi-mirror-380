- Installs a shell bootstrap function for one-command activation.
- Flexible CLI flags for advanced usage.

## Supported Shells

- **zsh** (full auto-activation)
- **sh** (full auto-activation)
- **fish** (full auto-activation)
- **powershell**, **pwsh** (full auto-activation)
- **cmd**, **batch**, **bat** (prints command for manual activation)

## Installation
**Recommended:** Install with pipx for isolated environments:
```bash
pipx install envon
```

**Alternative:** Install with pip (may fail on some distros like Ubuntu or Windows due to PEP 668):
```bash
python3 -m pip install envon
```

After installation, run:
```bash
envon --install
```
This detects your shell and sets up the bootstrap for auto-activation.

For more detailed installation instructions, see [docs/installation.md](https://github.com/userfrom1995/envon/blob/main/docs/installation.md).

## Usage
After installation and bootstrap setup, run:
```bash
envon
```
This will activate the nearest virtual environment in your project.

Supported flags: `--emit [SHELL]`, `--print-path`, `--install [SHELL]`.

## Contributor Note

**envon is in its early phase. Basic functionality is solid, but we welcome help!**
- TCSH/cshell and Nushell support need improvement (auto-activation, overlays).
- If you find issues, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/userfrom1995/envon/issues).
- If you'd like to contribute, fork and submit a PRâ€”contributions are very welcome!

Let's make envon the best Python venv activator for every shell!

## Release Notes
