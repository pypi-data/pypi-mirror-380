## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Your next great feature!

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- **Support for Europe-Specific Tool**:
    - Added `MorphingWorkflowEurope` class for advanced workflows with RCP scenarios and GCM-RCM pairs.
    - Added `morph_epw_europe` function for simple, one-shot morphing.
- **Parametric Analysis with `MorphingIterator`**: A powerful new class for running large batches of morphing simulations defined in a Pandas DataFrame or Excel file.
- **Excel Integration**: Added `export_template_to_excel` and `load_runs_from_excel` utility functions to allow users to define parametric runs in a spreadsheet.
- **Pre-flight LCZ Validation**: The `execute_morphing` methods and API functions now automatically check for Local Climate Zone (LCZ) availability before running, preventing errors.
- **LCZ Utility Functions**: Added `check_lcz_availability` and `get_available_lczs` to allow users to validate and discover available LCZs for their EPW files.
- **Robust Filename Overwrite Prevention**: The `MorphingIterator` now intelligently detects all parameters and file categories that vary between runs and raises an error if they are not included as placeholders in the `output_filename_pattern`, preventing accidental data loss.
- **Execution Plan Inspection**: The `MorphingIterator` now stores the final, detailed DataFrame of all runs in the `morphing_workflows_plan_df` attribute and the prepared instances in `prepared_workflows` for user inspection before execution.
- **Optional Colored Logging**: Added `colorlog` as a dependency to provide clear, color-coded terminal output for warnings and errors.

### Changed
- **API Renaming**: Renamed the original `morph_epw` function to `morph_epw_global` for clarity.
- **Workflow Refactoring**: Refactored the original `MorphingWorkflow` class into a more robust base class (`_MorphingWorkflowBase`) and two specialized child classes (`MorphingWorkflowGlobal`, `MorphingWorkflowEurope`) to eliminate code duplication and provide a clear, type-safe API.
- **Improved `MorphingIterator` Workflow**: The iterator now uses a more intuitive three-step process: `generate_morphing_workflows`, `prepare_workflows`, and `run_morphing_workflows`.
- **Enhanced `MorphingIterator` Flexibility**: The `set_default_values` method now has an explicit signature for all possible arguments, improving auto-completion and providing warnings for inapplicable parameters.

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical bug in `MorphingIterator` where default values for parameters not present in the user's DataFrame were not being applied correctly.
- Fixed a bug where the `MorphingIterator` was checking for the internal parameter name (`gcms`) instead of the public-facing one (`fwg_gcms`), causing validation to fail incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug in the `uhi_morph` utility where error logs were printed to the console even when handled internally, cleaning up the output for validation checks.
- Fixed a bug where temporary files were deleted even when `delete_temp_files=False`.
- Made the deletion of temporary files more robust on Windows to prevent `PermissionError`.
- Corrected the logic for including/excluding tutorial files and the `wip` directory in the final distribution package.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-20

- Initial bug fixes and improvements to the first public release.
