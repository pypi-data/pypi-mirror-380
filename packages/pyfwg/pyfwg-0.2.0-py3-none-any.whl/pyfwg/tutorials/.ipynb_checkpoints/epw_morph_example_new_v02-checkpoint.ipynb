    "# Using `pyfwg` for Direct Morphing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the simplest and most direct way to use the `pyfwg` library: the high-level API functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The library provides two main functions for this purpose:\n",
    "- `morph_epw_global()`: For use with the standard, global version of the FutureWeatherGenerator tool.\n",
    "- `morph_epw_europe()`: For use with the Europe-specific version of the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will focus on **`morph_epw_global`**. These functions are designed as one-shot tools that provide full access to all of the tool's parameters without requiring the user to manage the multi-step `MorphingWorkflow` class. They handle parameter validation, temporary file management, and final file placement in a single call."

    "## Understanding the `morph_epw` Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions are powerful because they expose all of the underlying tool's options. Here is a complete reference for all arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `epw_paths` (`Union[str, List[str]]`): **Required.** The path to a single EPW file (as a string) or a list of paths to multiple EPW files.\n",
    "*   `fwg_jar_path` (`str`): **Required.** The absolute or relative path to the appropriate `.jar` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Control Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `output_dir` (`str`, default: `'./morphed_epws'`): The directory where the final morphed `.epw` and `.stat` files will be saved.\n",
    "*   `delete_temp_files` (`bool`, default: `True`): If `True`, the temporary folders are deleted after processing. Set to `False` for debugging.\n",
    "*   `fwg_show_tool_output` (`bool`, default: `False`): If `True`, prints the FWG tool's console output in real-time. Highly recommended for monitoring progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### FutureWeatherGenerator Tool Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `fwg_gcms` (`Optional[List[str]]`, default: `None`): A list of GCMs to use. This is specific to the **global** tool (`morph_epw_global`).\n",
    "*   `fwg_rcm_pairs` (`Optional[List[str]]`, default: `None`): A list of GCM-RCM pairs to use. This is specific to the **europe** tool (`morph_epw_europe`).\n",
    "*   `fwg_create_ensemble` (`bool`, default: `True`): If `True`, creates an ensemble from the selected models.\n",
    "*   (All other `fwg_` parameters like `fwg_interpolation_method_id`, `fwg_add_uhi`, etc., are also available. Refer to the library's documentation for a full list.)"
