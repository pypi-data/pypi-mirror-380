- Flow in count______
	- DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING
	- FAIL EARLY
	- Implement "common foundational logic".
		- IDK what the correct technical term is, but I'm sure other people have researched excellent ways to do this.
		- Example: in `countFolds`, every possible flow path needs `mapShape`. Therefore, `mapShape` is foundational logic that
			all flow paths have in common: "common foundational logic".
		- Example: in `countFolds`, some flow paths have more than one "task division" (i.e., the computation is divided into
			multiple tasks), while other flow paths only have one task division. One reasonable perspective is that computing task
			divisions is NOT "common foundational logic". My perspective for this example: to compute whether or not there are
			task divisions and if so, how many task divisions is identical for all flow paths. Therefore, I handle computing task
			divisions as "common foundational logic".

	Count the total number of distinct ways to fold a map.

	Mathematicians also describe this as folding a strip of stamps, and they usually call the total "number of distinct ways to
	fold" a map the map's "foldings."

	Parameters
	----------
	listDimensions : Sequence[int] | None = None
		List of integers representing the dimensions of the map to be folded.
	pathLikeWriteFoldsTotal : PathLike[str] | PurePath | None = None
		A filename, a path of only directories, or a path with directories and a filename to which `countFolds` will write the
		value of `foldsTotal`. If `pathLikeWriteFoldsTotal` is a path of only directories, `countFolds` creates a filename based
		on the map dimensions.
	computationDivisions : int | str | None = None
		Whether and how to divide the computational work.
		- `None`: no division of the computation into tasks.
		- `int`: into how many tasks `countFolds` will divide the computation. The values 0 or 1 are identical to `None`. It is
		mathematically impossible to divide the computation into more tasks than the map's total leaves.
		- 'maximum': divides the computation into `leavesTotal`-many tasks.
		- 'cpu': divides the computation into the number of available CPUs.
	CPUlimit : bool | float | int | None = None
		If relevant, whether and how to limit the number of processors `countFolds` will use.
		- `False`, `None`, or `0`: No limits on processor usage; uses all available processors. All other values will
		potentially limit processor usage.
		- `True`: Yes, limit the processor usage; limits to 1 processor.
		- `int >= 1`: The maximum number of available processors to use.
		- `0 < float < 1`: The maximum number of processors to use expressed as a fraction of available processors.
		- `-1 < float < 0`: The number of processors to *not* use expressed as a fraction of available processors.
		- `int <= -1`: The number of available processors to *not* use.
		- If the value of `CPUlimit` is a `float` greater than 1 or less than -1, `countFolds` truncates the value to an `int`
		with the same sign as the `float`.
	mapShape : tuple[int, ...] | None = None
		Tuple of integers representing the dimensions of the map to be folded. Mathematicians almost always use the term
		"dimensions", such as in the seminal paper, "Multi-dimensional map-folding". Nevertheless, in contemporary Python
		programming, in the context of these algorithms, the term "shape" makes it much easier to align the mathematics with the
		syntax of the programming language.
	flow : str | None = None
		My stupid way of selecting the version of the algorithm to use in the computation. There are certainly better ways to do
		this, but I have not yet solved this issue. As of 2025 Aug 14, these values will work:
		- 'daoOfMapFolding'
		- 'numba'
		- 'theorem2'
		- 'theorem2Numba'
		- 'theorem2Trimmed'

	Returns
	-------
	foldsTotal: Total number of distinct ways to fold a map of the given dimensions.

	Note well
	---------
	You probably do not want to divide your computation into tasks.

	If you want to compute a large `foldsTotal`, dividing the computation into tasks is usually a bad idea. Dividing the
	algorithm into tasks is inherently inefficient: efficient division into tasks means there would be no overlap in the
	work performed by each task. When dividing this algorithm, the amount of overlap is between 50% and 90% by all
	tasks: at least 50% of the work done by every task must be done by each task. If you improve the computation time,
	it will only change by -10 to -50% depending on (at the very least) the ratio of the map dimensions and the number
	of leaves. If an undivided computation would take 10 hours on your computer, for example, the computation will still
	take at least 5 hours but you might reduce the time to 9 hours. Most of the time, however, you will increase the
	computation time. If logicalCores >= `leavesTotal`, it will probably be faster. If logicalCores <= 2 * `leavesTotal`, it
	will almost certainly be slower for all map dimensions.
