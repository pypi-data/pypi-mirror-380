    :param maxsize: The maximum size of the queue. Default is unlimited.
    :param timeout: The time, in seconds, that blocking operations should
        wait before erroring out.

    This class fixes a problem where a producer is feeding objects into a queue and
    then the consumer crashes. In this instance, the producer thread will raise
    a queue.Full exception, but the process can't close because there's still
    data to write to the queue. But since the consumer has crashed, this creates
    deadlock. If a write to a queue in this class times out, it breaks that deadlock
    by allowing the process to exit before the queue is flushed.
    This class is, more or less, a subclass of multiprocessing.Queue.
