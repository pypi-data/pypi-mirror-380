    """Fixes the loss terms in the logs to reflect the metrics, not the actual loss values.

    This is because of a stupid in Keras. If you use a loss function for the metrics,
    they will not give the same values, because of something something regularization.
    That is, if you do ``model.compile(loss=[fun], metrics=[fun])``, then the loss value
    will be different than the metric. I hate it. It's dumb. Worse, the value is *close* to
    the metric value.

    Since the way BPReveal tracks the components of the losses is by using different metrics,
    the assumption is that loss = sum(metrics). Instead of figuring out what regularization means,
    I simply redefine the loss in the logs for each epoch by overwriting the ``loss``
    (and ``val_loss``) items in the logs dict with the sums of the metrics. While the
    model trains based on the actual (perverted) loss, the callbacks see only the idealized
    loss value that this function stuffs into the logs dictionary.

        This must be the *first* callback when you compile your model.

    This updates the counts loss weights in your model on the fly, so that you can specify a
    target fraction of the loss that is due to counts, and the model will automatically update
    the weight. It currently does not update profile weights, so you can't yet automatically
    balance the losses in a multitask model.
    (You can still manually specify them in the config json, of course!)

    :param heads: Is straight from the json, except with "INTERNAL_counts-loss-weight-variable"

    :param earlyStopCallback: The early stopping callback that your model is going to use.
    :param checkpointCallback: The checkpoint callback that your model is going to use.


    ``aggression`` determines how aggressively the counts loss
    will be re-weighted. Lower values indicate slower changes, and a value of 1.0 means that
    the old loss should be completely discarded at each iteration.
    (If the newly calculated loss weight is ever off by over a factor of two, it's clamped to
    be exactly twice (or half) of the old weight, so that gross instability in the early stages
    doesn't cause the model to explode.)

    The three callbacks are the others used in the model, and the model should run them BEFORE
    this callback is executed.
    This callback messes with their internal state (naughty, naughty!) because changing the
    loss weights could cause the model's loss value to go up even though the model hasn't
    gotten any worse.

    .. note:
        Since Keras 3.0 doesn't separate out multiple components of the loss and also it lies
