This directory holds symlinks to the src/ and tools/ directories in a way that makes it easy to
import bits of bpreveal into your python programs without having to faff about with sys.path
To use it, you need to create a file in your anaconda environment's site-packages folder.
There are a couple ways to do this. 
1. (recommended) Use `conda develop` to create a .pth file
    First, run this command to get the necessary tool:
    conda install conda-build
    Then, either
        conda develop -p <your-environment-location> /wherever/you/cloned/the/git/repo/bpreveal/pkg
        or
        conda develop -n <your-environment-name> /wherever/you/cloned/the/git/repo/bpreveal/pkg
        depending on whether you specify your environment by path or by name.

2.Create the .pth file manually.
    echo "/wherever/you/cloned/the/git/repo/bpreveal/pkg" > ${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib/python3.10/site-packages/bpreveal.pth

Then, inside your program, you just say

from bpreveal.utils import oneHotEncode
