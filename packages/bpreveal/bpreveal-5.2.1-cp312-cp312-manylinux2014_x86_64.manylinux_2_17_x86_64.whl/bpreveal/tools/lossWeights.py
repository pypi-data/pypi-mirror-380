"""Extract loss weights that should be used to train a model.

This is a little utility to read in the training history json and calculate
an appropriate counts loss weight parameter to get the loss balance you want.
Since we only know how large the losses for profile and counts will be after
we've trained a model, you have to use this script *after* training a burner model
in order to find appropriate settings, then use those to re-train your model.
How to use:
First, pick a counts-loss-weight that sounds reasonable, like 10. Train a model.
Run this script on the history json from that training, giving it a desired
ratio of counts to profile loss.

Note that this script is not necessary if you're using the adaptive counts
loss algorithm.
