# BPReveal
BPReveal is a suite of tools for building and interpreting sequence-to-profile
models of biological data. The model architectures are based on chrombpnet,
which is in turn based on BPNet. It incorporates PISA analysis, which extracts
pairwise interactions between every base in a model's input and each one of
its outputs.

You can find the documentation [here](https://bpreveal.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

# Components
BPReveal is designed as a set of command-line tools that can be flexibly
combined for many analysis tasks. A precise specification for each tool can be
found in the documentation.

You can find a tutorial for training a model on transcription factor data in
mouse in [this document](doc/demos/osknExample.pdf)

## Organization
BPReveal follows a traditional Unix-style directory structure:
- `bin` contains the executables. This is added to your path when you use one
  of the provided scripts to build a conda environment.
- `doc` contains examples of using the package along with a formal
  specification of all the file types and programs.
    - `doc/demos` contains demonstrations of fun things you can do with
      BPReveal.
    - `doc/presentations` contains (you guessed it!) presentations related to
      BPReveal.
- `pkg` is a silly folder that is added to your python search path, letting you
  `import bpreveal.utils` without having to mess about with $PYTHONPATH. You
  can ignore it.
- `src` contains all the programs.
    - `src/schematools` contains the json schema that are used to validate the
      input to the programs.
    - `src/internal` contains source code that must be compiled using the f2py
      routines in numpy.
    - `src/tools` contains a hodgepodge of scripts that are useful for specific
      tasks. These are not actively maintained and tested, but may be useful.
- `test` contains the files that are used in the demonstration notebooks. Note
  that `test` is not committed to the git repository - it's many gigabytes of
  data files. If you're on the Stowers network, you can find this directory at
  `/n/projects/cm2363/bpreveal/test`.


## Documentation

The readthedocs documentation is kept current, but you can easily get your own
local copy. The BPReveal project uses Sphinx to generate documentation. If you
want to build the documentation, make sure that `INSTALL_DEVTOOLS=true` in the
conda install script, then run `make html`, `make man`, or `make latexpdf` in
the doc directory. Documentation will be in `doc/_build/html/index.html`,
`doc/_build/man`, or `doc/_build/latex/bpreveal.pdf`. If you use the buildConda
scripts, then it will put the man pages on `MANPATH` but you need to `make man`
in the `doc/` directory to generate the pages.

If you're at Stowers, then the documentation will be included in the
repositories that I maintain at /n/projects/cm2363/public-bpreveal/<version>/doc.
You can use `man bpreveal` to get a list of the available man pages.

## Installing
There are two ways to install BPReveal: `pip` or `conda`. For most users, `pip` will
be easier, but the `conda` install offers more flexibility and is better if
you're working on the BPReveal source code.

To install BPReveal with pip, download the wheel file from one of the releases on
GitHub, and run `pip install bpreveal-x.y.z-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl`.
I would recommend setting up a conda environment or other virtual environment,
because BPReveal pulls in a lot of other dependencies.
You will need Python 3.12 in this environment, which you can specify when you
create it: `conda create -n bpreveal python=3.12`

To install BPReveal as a conda environment, EDIT and then run one of the
`buildConda` scripts in the root directory. If you're using the Cerebro cluster
at Stowers, run `buildCondaCerebro.slurm`. If you're installing BPReveal on a
local machine, run `buildCondaLocal.zsh`. If you're at Stowers, you can just
activate one of the conda environments I maintain at
/n/projects/cm2363/public-bpreveal/(version)/env.
