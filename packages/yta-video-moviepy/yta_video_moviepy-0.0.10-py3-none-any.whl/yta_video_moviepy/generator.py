We have two different types of clips
related to moviepy:

- `static` - The clip doesn't change
along its duration time. Each frame
is exactly the same as the previous
and the next one.
- `dynamic` - The clip changes along
its duration time. Each frame can be
different to the previous and the 
next one.
