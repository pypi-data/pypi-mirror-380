    Fixes an issue which triggers two recovery workflows for the same
    host failure. `LP#1961110
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/masakari/+bug/1961110>`__

    It introduces distributed lock for Masakari-api services when handle
    the concurrent notifications for the same host failure from multiple
    Masakari-hostmonitor services. To enable coordination, the user needs
    to set the new configuration option ``[coordination]backend_url``,
    which specifies the backend.
