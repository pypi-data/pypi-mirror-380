Sample Masakari Policy File

.. warning::

   JSON formatted policy file is deprecated since Masakari 11.0.0 (Wallaby).
   This `oslopolicy-convert-json-to-yaml`__ tool will migrate your existing
   JSON-formatted policy file to YAML in a backward-compatible way.

The following is a sample masakari policy file for adaptation and use.
