"""
Provides custom exception classes to handle errors arising from persistence-related operations.

This module defines base and specific exceptions to enable robust error handling in persistence
scenarios. The base class `PersistenceError` covers generic persistence issues, while
`DuplicateKeyError` and `ObjectNotFoundError` address specific cases like duplicate entries
and missing records respectively.

    a custom error message and an optional cause, offering more insight into
    what caused the error. This aids in debugging and understanding context
    in persistence-related failures.
