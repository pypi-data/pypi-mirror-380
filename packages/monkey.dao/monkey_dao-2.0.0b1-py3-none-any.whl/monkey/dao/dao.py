"""
Provides a generic specification for implementing the [Data Access Object (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object) design model.

The term 'data collection' refers to either a table in a relational database or a record in a NoSQL database.

This speciation will have to be implemented by each database system.

    Generic definition of Data Access Object.

    This class defines a common interface for all DAOs, so most methods will have to be overridden in subclasses,
    depending on the type of data collection used.

    Most of these methods accept a **kwargs parameter that can be used to pass additional arguments to the underlying
