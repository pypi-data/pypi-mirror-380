== Components

=== Llama Stack Server
The main server that receives requests and coordinates with the remote provider.

=== Remote Provider
The provider implementation that creates and manages Kubeflow Pipelines for evaluation.

=== Kubeflow Pipelines API
The interface for creating, submitting, and monitoring evaluation pipelines.

=== Kubernetes Pod
Isolated containers where the actual RAGAS evaluation runs.

=== S3 Results Storage
S3-compatible storage system for evaluation results and artifacts. The Llama Stack server fetches results from S3 after pipeline completion.
