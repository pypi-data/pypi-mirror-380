= Remote Provider Usage
:navtitle: Usage

== Starting the Server

Start the Llama Stack server with the included distribution configuration:

[,bash]
----
dotenv run uv run llama stack run distribution/run-remote.yaml
----

This will start a server with the remote Ragas evaluation provider available.

== Basic Evaluation Workflow

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your evaluation data is in the format expected by Ragas and Llama Stack
2. **Submit Evaluation**: Use the Llama Stack eval API to submit your evaluation request
3. **Pipeline Execution**: Remote provider creates and executes Kubeflow Pipeline
4. **Monitor Progress**: Track evaluation progress through Kubeflow APIs
5. **Collect Results**: Results are automatically collected and returned

== Example Workflow

The repository includes demonstration examples in the `demos/` directory showing how to use the remote provider.
