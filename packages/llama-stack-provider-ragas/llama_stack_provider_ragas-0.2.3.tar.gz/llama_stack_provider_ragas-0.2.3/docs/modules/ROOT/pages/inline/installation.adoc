= Inline Provider Installation
:navtitle: Installation

== Prerequisites

* Python 3.12 or later
* https://docs.astral.sh/uv/[uv] package manager

== One-liner setup for the impatient

- Running this command will start a Llama Stack server with the Ragas provider installed, and use the minimal distribution that is the `distribution` directory.
- Note that we are asking for the `[distro]` dependency group (more info below).
- Also note that, for this one-liner to work, you will need to have your environment variables set up (see xref:inline/configuration.adoc#_environment_variables[Environment Variables]).


[,bash]
----
uv run --with llama-stack-provider-ragas[distro] llama stack run distribution/run-inline.yaml
----

== Installing with uv

To get started with uv, create a virtual environment and install from PyPI:

[,bash]
----
uv venv --python=3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install llama-stack-provider-ragas
----

== Development setup

If you're planning to contribute and make modifications to the code, ensure that you clone the repository and set it up as an editable install:

[,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/llama-stack-provider-ragas
cd llama-stack-provider-ragas
uv pip install -e .
----

== Optional dependencies for inline provider

The package includes several optional dependency groups:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Group |Description

|`dev`
|Development dependencies including testing tools, linting, and type checking

|`distro`
|Dependencies to use the provided minimal Llama Stack distribution under `distribution/`
|===

=== Installing with optional dependencies

[,bash]
----
# For development (includes all dependencies)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# For using the sample distribution
uv pip install -e ".[distro]"

# Base installation (inline provider only)
uv pip install -e "."
----
