= Inline Provider Architecture
:navtitle: Architecture

== Overview

The inline provider architecture is straightforward, running everything within the Llama Stack server process:

== Components

=== Llama Stack Server
The main server process that handles all requests and coordinates between different providers.

=== Inline Ragas Provider
The provider implementation that handles RAGAS evaluation requests directly within the server process.

=== RAGAS Engine
The core RAGAS evaluation engine that runs the actual metrics calculations.

=== Direct Memory Processing
All data processing happens in memory within the same process, providing fast access but sharing resources.

== Process Flow

1. **Request Reception**: Client requests are received by the Llama Stack server
2. **Provider Selection**: Server routes evaluation requests to the inline RAGAS provider
3. **Direct Processing**: Provider loads data and runs evaluation in the same process
4. **Result Return**: Results are immediately available and returned to the client
