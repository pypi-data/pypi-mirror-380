= Ragas provider for Llama Stack
:navtitle: Overview

https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/llama-stack-provider-ragas[View on GitHub]

== About

This repository implements https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas[Ragas] as an out-of-tree https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack[Llama Stack] evaluation provider.

The goal is to provide all of Ragas' evaluation functionality over Llama Stack's eval API, while leveraging the Llama Stack's built-in APIs for inference (llms and embeddings), datasets, and benchmarks.

== Two Providers

There are two versions of the provider:

* `inline`: runs the Ragas evaluation in the same process as the Llama Stack server.
* `remote`: runs the Ragas evaluation in a remote process, using Kubeflow Pipelines.

== Getting Started
