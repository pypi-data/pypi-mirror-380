# Git Workflow for Contributing to Upstream

## Quick Sync Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Sync with upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
echo "âœ… Synced with upstream"
```

## Check Status vs Upstream
```bash
# Quick check: are you ahead/behind upstream/main?
git rev-list --count --left-right HEAD...upstream/main
# Output: "X Y" where X=commits ahead, Y=commits behind

# What commits are in upstream that you don't have?
git log --oneline HEAD..upstream/main

# What commits do you have that upstream doesn't?
git log --oneline upstream/main..HEAD

# Visual branch comparison
git show-branch HEAD upstream/main
```

## Common Commands
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Update existing PR branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
git push origin feature/your-feature-name --force-with-lease
```
