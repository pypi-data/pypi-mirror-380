The currencies identified in the COFER dataset are: U.S. dollar, Pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Chinese renminbi, and Euro.  All other currencies are included in the category of “other currencies.”  Prior to the introduction of the Euro in 1999, several European currencies were separately identified in COFER: European Currency Unit, Deutsche mark, French franc, and the Netherlands guilder.\n\nCOFER data are reported to the IMF on a voluntary and confidential basis by central banks from over 140 economies. COFER data for individual countries are strictly confidential. At present there are 149 reporters, consisting of the monetary authorities of IMF member countries and non-IMF member countries/economies; and of other foreign exchange reserves holding entities. COFER includes a list of the participating economies that agreed to disclose their names. SDDS Plus adherents are required to participate in the COFER database and to disclose their participation. The data published on this website are aggregates for each currency for the world, advanced economies, and emerging markets and developing economies. Starting 2015Q2, the IMF decided to cease the publication of the latter two geographical breakdowns to avoid possible residual disclosure of individual data with the release of the list of countries who have agreed to publish their names as COFER reporters.   Estimates of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves are critical for the smooth functioning of national and international financial systems.  \n\nForeign Exchange Reserves (FXR) data reported to COFER are consistent with the \"other reserve assets\" classification of reserve assets as outlined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). They are reserve assets other than monetary gold, SDRs, and reserve position in the IMF; and consist of the monetary authorities' claims on nonresidents in the form of: Currency and deposits, Securities, Financial derivatives, and Other claims.  \n     \nAllocated Foreign Exchange Reserves: in the context of COFER, Allocated FXR is the COFER category in which reporting countries identify and report the currency of denomination of their FXR.\n\nUnallocated Foreign Exchange Reserves: in the context of COFER, Unallocated FXR is a residual COFER category consisting of the difference between total FXR sourced from the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the total allocated reserves in COFER. It has two components: (i) the total FXR of nonreporting countries; and (ii) the discrepancy (if any) between the IFS total FXR of COFER-reporting countries and the total allocated FXR in COFER.",

Arithmetic weighted averages are used for all concepts except for inflation and broad money, for which geometric averages are used. PPP GDP weights from the WEO database are used for the aggregation of real GDP growth, real non-oil GDP growth, real per capita GDP growth, investment, national savings, broad money, claims on the nonfinancial private sector, and real and nominal effective exchange rates.
