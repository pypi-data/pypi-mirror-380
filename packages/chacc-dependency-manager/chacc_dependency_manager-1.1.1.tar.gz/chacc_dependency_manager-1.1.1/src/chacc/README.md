# ChaCC Dependency Manager

**Smart dependency resolution with intelligent caching.** ChaCC (Cache-Checked) is a dependency manager for Python that is up to 20x faster than pip for repeated installations. It's designed to accelerate your development workflows, especially in environments like Docker and CI/CD pipelines.

## üéØ When to Use ChaCC

ChaCC is a powerful tool, but it's not always a replacement for pip. Here‚Äôs when to choose one over the other:

**Use ChaCC when you:**
*   Frequently build Docker images.
*   Work with projects that have many dependencies.
*   Manage applications with a modular structure.
*   Need to speed up your CI/CD pipelines.
*   Want automatic and intelligent cache management.

**Keep using pip for:**
*   Simple, single-file projects.
*   One-off installations of a few packages.
*   Basic development environments where speed is not a primary concern.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to give ChaCC a try? Here's how to get up and running in a few simple steps.

### üì¶ Installation

You can install ChaCC using pip. For most users, installing it with the `[resolver]` extra is recommended as it includes the command-line interface (CLI).

```bash
# Recommended installation with CLI commands
pip install chacc-dependency-manager[resolver]

# Basic installation (library only)
pip install chacc-dependency-manager

# Full development setup
pip install chacc-dependency-manager[full]
```

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Quick Usage

The easiest way to use ChaCC is through its command-line interface.

1.  **Navigate to your project directory** that contains a `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    cd your_project
    ```
2.  **Run the install command.** ChaCC provides a few aliases for its commands: `chacc-dependency-manager`, `chacc-dm`, or the shortest, `cdm`.
    ```bash
    cdm install
    ```

ChaCC will find your `requirements.txt`, resolve the dependencies, and install them. If you run it again, it will use its smart cache to complete the process almost instantly.

You can also install specific packages directly:
```bash
cdm install fastapi uvicorn
```

## üíª Usage Guide

ChaCC can be used from the command line or programmatically in your Python code.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is the most common way to interact with ChaCC.

#### **Installing Dependencies**

```bash
# Auto-discover and install from requirements.txt in the current directory
cdm install

# Install from a specific requirements file
cdm install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install specific packages
cdm install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy
```

#### **Managing the Cache**

```bash
# View cache information
cdm cache --info

# Clear the entire cache
cdm cache --clear

# Clear the cache for a specific module
cdm cache --clear --module auth
```

#### **Resolving Dependencies Without Installing**

You can see what ChaCC *would* install without actually installing the packages.

```bash
# Check what would be installed from requirements.txt
cdm resolve

# Check for a specific file
cdm resolve -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Programmatic Usage (Python)

You can also use ChaCC within your Python applications to manage dependencies dynamically.

#### **Simple Usage**

For most cases, a single function call is all you need. ChaCC will automatically handle caching.

```python
import asyncio
from chacc import re_resolve_dependencies

# This function will find, resolve, and install dependencies
asyncio.run(re_resolve_dependencies())
```

#### **Advanced Usage with a Config Object**

If you need more control, you can use a `Config` object to customize behavior, such as setting a custom cache directory or adding hooks.

```python
import asyncio
from chacc import Config, re_resolve_dependencies

# Create a configuration object
config = Config(
    cache_dir='./my_custom_cache',
    pre_resolve_hook=lambda name, req: print(f"Resolving {name}")
)

# Pass the config to the function
asyncio.run(re_resolve_dependencies(config=config))
```

#### **Full Control with `DependencyManager`**

For complete control over every aspect of the dependency resolution process, you can use the `DependencyManager` class.

```python
import asyncio
from chacc import DependencyManager

# Instantiate the manager with your desired settings
dm = DependencyManager(
    cache_dir='./my_cache'
)

# Resolve dependencies
asyncio.run(dm.resolve_dependencies())
```

## üöÄ Why is ChaCC Faster?

ChaCC's primary advantage is its intelligent caching. On the first run, its speed is comparable to pip. However, for subsequent runs, the speed improvements are significant, especially in automated environments.

| Scenario | `pip install` | `chacc-dependency-manager` | Speed Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Docker rebuild (no changes)** | 45s | <2s | **22x faster** ‚ö° |
| **CI/CD pipeline** | 60s | 3s | **20x faster** ‚ö° |
| **Large monorepo** | 120s | 15s | **8x faster** ‚ö° |
| **First run** | 45s | 45s | Same (as expected) |

### Key Features

*   üß† **Smart Caching**: Only re-installs dependencies that have changed.
*   üîÑ **Incremental Updates**: Avoids full reinstalls, saving significant time.
*   üì¶ **Multi-File Support**: Handles complex projects with multiple `requirements.txt` files.
*   üê≥ **Docker-Optimized**: Works seamlessly with Docker's layer caching for faster image builds.
*   üîç **Package Validation**: Verifies that cached packages are still installed correctly.
*   üìù **Debug Logging**: Provides detailed output to help you understand caching behavior.

## üê≥ Docker and CI/CD Integration

ChaCC is particularly effective in containerized and automated environments.

### Docker Usage

Here is a simple, cache-friendly Dockerfile that leverages ChaCC.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Install the dependency manager
RUN pip install chacc-dependency-manager[resolver]

# Copy your requirements files
COPY requirements*.txt ./

# Install dependencies using ChaCC's intelligent caching
# This step will be almost instant if requirements haven't changed
RUN cdm install

# Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# Run your application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Caching (GitHub Actions)

You can use caching in your CI/CD pipelines to persist the ChaCC cache between runs.

```yaml
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: .dependency_cache
    key: deps-${{ hashFiles('requirements*.txt', 'pyproject.toml') }}

- name: Install dependencies
  run: cdm install
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Topics

### Auto-Discovery of Requirements

ChaCC can automatically discover requirement files based on common patterns.

**Supported Patterns:**
*   `"requirements.txt"` (default)
*   `"*.txt"`
*   `"requirements-*.txt"`

ChaCC will search for these files in the current directory or a specified `modules_dir`.

### Custom Hooks for Deeper Integration

For advanced use cases, you can inject your own logic into the resolution process using hooks.

*   `pre_resolve_hook`: A function that runs *before* dependencies are resolved.
*   `post_resolve_hook`: A function that runs *after* dependencies are resolved.
*   `install_hook`: A function to handle the installation of packages, allowing you to override the default installation logic.

```python
def log_start(module_name, requirements):
    print(f"Starting resolution for {module_name}")

def log_complete(module_name, resolved_packages):
    print(f"Resolved {len(resolved_packages)} packages for {module_name}")

dm = DependencyManager(
    pre_resolve_hook=log_start,
    post_resolve_hook=log_complete
)
```

### API Reference

#### `Config` Class
A simple data class for holding configuration.

```python
@dataclass
class Config:
    cache_dir: Optional[str] = None
    logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None
    pre_resolve_hook: Optional[Callable] = None
    post_resolve_hook: Optional[Callable] = None
    install_hook: Optional[Callable] = None
```

#### `DependencyManager` Class
The core class that manages dependency resolution.

```python
class DependencyManager:
    async def resolve_dependencies(self, ...): ...
    def invalidate_cache(self): ...
    def invalidate_module_cache(self, module_name: str): ...
```
