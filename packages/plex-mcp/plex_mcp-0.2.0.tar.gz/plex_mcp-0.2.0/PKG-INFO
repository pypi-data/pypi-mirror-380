# 🎬 Plex MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to interact with your Plex Media Server! 🚀

### TL;DR

To use this server with an MCP client (like Cursor), add this configuration to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "plex-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "plex-mcp",
        "--baseurl",
        "<PLEX_BASEURL>",
        "--token",
        "<PLEX_TOKEN>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<PLEX_BASEURL>` / `<PLEX_TOKEN>` with your actual Plex server URL and authentication token.
