## Futurama - TV Show Overview

**Futurama** (1999) is an animated sci-fi comedy series created by Matt Groening. The show follows the adventures of Philip J. Fry, a pizza delivery boy who accidentally gets cryogenically frozen on New Year's Eve 1999 and wakes up 1,000 years later in the year 3000. He joins the Planet Express delivery company with his new friends: Leela (a one-eyed alien), Bender (a kleptomaniacal robot), and Professor Farnsworth (Fry's 160-year-old great-great-great-great-grandnephew).

## Notable Episodes

### **Season 1 Highlights:**

**"Space Pilot 3000" (S1E1)** - The series premiere where Fry gets frozen and wakes up in the year 3000, meeting his new friends and starting work at Planet Express.

**"Love's Labours Lost in Space" (S1E4)** - Leela meets the legendary (and hilariously incompetent) Captain Zapp Brannigan, and the crew rescues endangered animals on a collapsing planet. Leela finds love with Nibbler, a cute but mysterious creature.

**"A Fishful of Dollars" (S1E6)** - Fry discovers his bank account interest has made him a billionaire, and he buys the one thing the year 3000 doesn't have: anchovies.

### **Season 2 Standouts:**

**"The Honking" (S3E1)** - A horror-themed episode where Bender inherits a cursed castle and the crew must deal with a supernatural threat.

**"Jurassic Bark" (S5E2)** - One of the most emotional episodes where Fry finds his fossilized dog Seymour and learns about his dog's loyalty over the centuries.

**"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings" (S5E16)** - The original series finale where Fry makes a deal with the Robot Devil to get robot hands so he can play the holophoner and impress Leela.

### **Later Seasons:**

**"The Late Philip J. Fry" (S6E7)** - The Professor invents a one-way time machine that takes the crew ever further into the future with no hope of returning.

**"Meanwhile" (S7E26)** - The series finale where Fry asks Leela to marry him, and they face their destiny together as the Professor's latest invention alters the fabric of time.

**"The Impossible Stream" (S8E1)** - Fry risks permanent insanity when he attempts to binge-watch every TV show ever made.

The series is known for its clever writing, scientific humor, emotional depth, and memorable characters. It has been praised for balancing comedy with surprisingly touching moments, especially in episodes dealing with Fry's past and relationships. The show has been revived multiple times and continues to be beloved by fans for its unique blend of science fiction and humor.
