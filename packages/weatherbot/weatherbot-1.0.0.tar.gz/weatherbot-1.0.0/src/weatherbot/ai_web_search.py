        5-LEVEL WEATHER ALERT SYSTEM:
        Level 1: ‚úÖ All Clear - No active weather threats. Normal conditions.
        Level 2: üå™Ô∏è Weather Watch - Potential severe weather within 24-48 hours. Monitor conditions.
        Level 3: ‚ö†Ô∏è Weather Warning - Severe weather conditions possible within 12-24 hours. Prepare for impacts.
        Level 4: üö® Severe Weather Alert - Dangerous weather conditions expected within 6-12 hours. Take immediate precautions.
        Level 5: üõë Emergency Weather Warning - Life-threatening weather conditions imminent or occurring. Seek immediate shelter.

        ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
        - Look for official weather warnings, watches, or alerts
        - Consider tropical cyclones, severe storms, flooding, extreme temperatures
        - Assess evacuation orders or emergency declarations
        - Evaluate storm intensity and proximity to the location
        - Consider seasonal weather patterns (monsoon, typhoon season, etc.)

        RESPONSE FORMAT:
        ALERT_LEVEL: [1-5]
        TITLE: [Professional alert title appropriate to threat level]
        MESSAGE: [Detailed assessment including:
        - Current Weather Status: [Summary of current conditions and any active alerts]
        - Threat Assessment: [Analysis of specific weather threats based on search results]
        - Official Warnings: [Any official weather warnings or alerts found]
        - Recommended Actions: [Actions appropriate to the threat level]
        - Timeline: [Expected timing of weather impacts]
        - Data Sources: [Note that this analysis is based on web search data, not NOAA]
        - Limitations: [Note that this location is outside NOAA coverage area]
        ]

        IMPORTANT NOTES:
        - This location is outside NOAA coverage area
        - Analysis is based on web search data, not official NOAA forecasts
        - Results may be less accurate than NOAA-sourced data
        - Always recommend checking local meteorological services
        - Be conservative in threat assessment when data is limited
