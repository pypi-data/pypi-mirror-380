## Overview

Weatherbot is a comprehensive hurricane monitoring and alerting system designed to provide real-time notifications for tropical weather threats. It combines data from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecast cones, National Weather Service (NWS) alerts, and optional AI-powered analysis of official NOAA weather maps to deliver precise, location-specific threat assessments.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Hurricane Tracking**: Monitors active NHC forecast cones and determines if your location is at risk
- **NWS Alert Integration**: Receives and processes official hurricane watches and warnings
- **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Optional OpenAI integration for intelligent threat assessment using official NOAA maps
- **Multi-level Alert System**: 5-tier alert system from "All Clear" to "Hurricane Warning"
- **Multiple Notification Methods**: Toast notifications
- **Geometric Precision**: Point-in-polygon and county-level intersection analysis
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed HTML reports with storm tracking maps
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports both point-based and county-based threat detection

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Windows 10/11 (for toast notifications)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathanramoscfa/weatherbot.git
   cd weatherbot
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Linux/macOS
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the package**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies** (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables**:
   Copy `env.example` to `.env` and configure your settings:
   ```bash
   copy env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` with your location and preferences:
   ```env
   # Required: Your home coordinates
   HOME_LAT=25.7617
   HOME_LON=-80.1918

   # Optional: OpenAI API key for AI analysis
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   # Optional: County-based intersection (requires GeoJSON file)
   USE_COUNTY_INTERSECT=false
   COUNTY_GEOJSON_PATH=src/weatherbot/data/default_area.geojson

   # Alert settings
   ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=60
   TOAST_ENABLED=true
   ```

## How to Run

### Basic Monitoring

Run the main monitoring cycle:
```bash
weatherbot run
```

Run once and exit (useful for scheduled tasks):
```bash
weatherbot run --once
```

Run with verbose logging:
```bash
weatherbot run --verbose
```

### AI-Powered Analysis

Get AI analysis of current hurricane threats:
```bash
weatherbot ai-analysis
```

**üåç Global Coverage**: For locations outside NOAA coverage areas, weatherbot automatically uses AI web search to find weather alerts and warnings from local meteorological services, providing worldwide weather threat analysis.

### Testing Notifications

Test your notification systems:
```bash
weatherbot test-alert
```

### Check Coverage

Validate if your coordinates are within NOAA coverage areas:
```bash
weatherbot check-coverage
```

### View Official Maps

Open the official NOAA hurricane map:
```bash
weatherbot show-map
```

### State Management

View current state:
```bash
weatherbot state show
```

Clear state file:
```bash
weatherbot state clear
```

### Debug Commands

View NHC MapServer layers:
```bash
weatherbot debug layers
```

Show detailed storm data:
```bash
weatherbot debug storm-data
```

Test AI storm detection:
```bash
weatherbot debug test-ai
```

Clear API cache:
```bash
weatherbot debug clear-cache
```

- `ALERT_COOLDOWN_MINUTES`: Minimum time between alerts (default: 60)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

### Notification Settings

- `TOAST_ENABLED`: Enable Windows toast notifications

## Alert Levels

1. **Level 1 - All Clear**: No threats detected
2. **Level 2 - Tropical Storm Threat**: Tropical storm conditions possible
3. **Level 3 - Hurricane Threat**: Hurricane conditions possible, tropical storm watch/warning may be in effect
4. **Level 4 - Evacuation Zone**: Hurricane watch in effect, evacuation may be recommended
5. **Level 5 - Hurricane Warning**: Hurricane warning in effect, immediate action required
