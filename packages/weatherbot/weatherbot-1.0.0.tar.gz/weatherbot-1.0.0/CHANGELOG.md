## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

Please report security vulnerabilities to the maintainers privately before public disclosure.

### Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data is logged
- Network requests use HTTPS
- Input validation prevents injection attacks

## Performance

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: 512MB minimum, 1GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100MB for installation, 500MB for cache/logs
- **Network**: Broadband internet connection recommended
- **CPU**: Modern multi-core processor recommended

### Performance Metrics
- **Startup Time**: < 5 seconds
- **Analysis Time**: 10-30 seconds per cycle
- **Memory Usage**: 50-100MB typical
- **Network Usage**: 1-5MB per analysis cycle

### Optimization Tips
- Use appropriate alert cooldown periods
- Enable caching for frequent API calls
- Adjust logging levels for performance
- Monitor system resources during continuous operation
