        Adds a specified number of local consumptions to a  feature, updating its consumption count.

        This method identifies a feature by its code and increments its local consumption by a given number. It performs several checks to validate the operation:
        1. It verifies the existence of the feature object. If the feature does not exist, it raises an `ItemNotFoundError`.
        2. It checks if the feature's type is set to "consumption". If not, a `LicenseSpringTypeError` is raised to indicate the feature is not of the consumption type.
        3. It determines whether the feature allows unlimited consumptions. If so, it directly increments the local consumption count.
