Builds the agent image for a service.

This command builds the Docker runtime images for the agent defined in a service configuration file `service.yaml`. By default, the command tags the generated images as

```
<author>/oar-<agent_package>:<package_hash>
```

where `<author>` is the author name from the local CLI config (specified with `autonomy init`), `oar` stands for "Open Autonomy Runtime", and `<agent_package>:<package_hash>` is the `PUBLIC_ID` of the agent. These default tags can be modified using certain options described below.

!!! warning "Important"

    The images are built by fetching the packages from the IFPS registry. Therefore, before running the command, make sure that all the required packages are published on the IPFS registry.

## Usage

```bash
autonomy build-image [OPTIONS] [AGENT_PUBLIC_ID]
```

## Options

`--service-dir PATH`
:   Path to the service directory.

`-e, --extra-dependency DEPENDENCY`

:   Provide extra dependency.

`--version TEXT`
:   Version tag for the image.

`--image-author TEXT`
:   Author name for the image.

`--pull`
:   Pull the latest dependencies when building the image.

`-f, --dockerfile FILE`
:   Specify custom `Dockerfile` for building the agent

`--help`
:   Show the help message and exit.

## Examples

* Build the runtime image for a service located in the folder `your_service`:

    ```bash
    autonomy build-image --service-dir /your_service
    ```

    Or, alternatively:

    ```bash
    cd /your_service
    autonomy build-image
    ```

* Build the agent image for a specific service without fetching the service package:

    ```bash
    autonomy build-image <author>/<agent_package>:<package_hash>
    ```

    where `<author>/<package_name>:<package_hash>` is the `PUBLIC_ID` of the agent.

* Build an agent image with a custom version tag:

    ```bash
    autonomy build-image <author>/<agent_package>:<package_hash> --version <version>
    ```

    This will tag the image as `<author>/oar-<agent_package>:<version>`.

* Build an agent image with a custom author name:

    ```bash
    autonomy build-image <author>/<agent_package>:<package_hash> --image-author <custom_author>
    ```

    This will tag the image as `<custom_author>/oar-<agent_package>:<package_hash>`.

* Include extra python packages:

    ```bash
    autonomy build-image ... -e open-aea-ledger-flashbots==2.0.6
    ```

    This will tag the image as `<author>/oar-<agent_package>:<version>`.
