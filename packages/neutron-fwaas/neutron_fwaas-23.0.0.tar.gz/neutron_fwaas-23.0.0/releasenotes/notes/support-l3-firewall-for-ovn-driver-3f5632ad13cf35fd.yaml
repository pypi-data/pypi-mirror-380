features:
  - L3 stateless firewall support for ML2/OVN driver is implemented.
issues:
  - |
    If the user configures stateful security group rules for VMs ports and
    stateless L3 firewall rules for gateway ports like this:

        - SG ingress rules: --remote_ip_prefix 0.0.0.0/0
        - FW ingress rules: --destination_ip_address 0.0.0.0/0 --action allow

    It only opens ingress traffic for another network to access VM, but the
    reply traffic (egress direction) also passes because it matches the
    committed conntrack entry.
    So it only works well with stateless security groups for VMs.
