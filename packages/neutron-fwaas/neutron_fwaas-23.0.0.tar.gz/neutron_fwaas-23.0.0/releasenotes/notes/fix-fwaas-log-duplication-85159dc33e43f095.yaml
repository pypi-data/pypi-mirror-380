    The logging configuration for Neutron
    Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) has been
    enhanced to allow better control over
    log output destinations. Specifically,
    when a custom log file is specified using
    the network_log.local_output_log_base option,
    logs will no longer be duplicated in the
    default neutron-l3-agent.log file.
