## 1.5. Warranties

We provide no warranties of any sort.

You use our Products at your sole risk. We provide these Products on an "as is" and "as available" basis. 

We make no guarantees that our Products will meet your specific requirements or expectations.

We test our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Products inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Products.

### 1.5.1 Service Level Agreement (SLA)

We do not offer Service-Level Agreements (SLA), but do take uptime of our Services very seriously. 
Visit our Status Page (https://status.pitchmeld.ing) to see the status of our Products.
No express or implied warranty is provided with respect to any specific SLA threshold.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any day is determined to have experienced significant downtime, we will do our best to provide compensation to affected customers in a manner deemed proportionate to the impact of such downtime.
The Status Page shall constitute the authoritative source for determining the occurrence and extent of downtime.
The Company expressly reserves the exclusive right to interpret the terms "significant," "proportionate," and "impact" in connection with this provision.

We believe the maintenance of a high service level, as evidenced by the Status Page, and the provision of a fair compensation mechanism should be convincing enough for our Users to keep using our Products.

### 1.5.2 Rights to Minor and Revision Updates

The purchase of a Product at a specific version entitles you to receive all minor and revision updates (i.e., updates to the last two numbers of a version number) made available for that specific major version. For example, acquisition of version 1.2.3 confers the right to access subsequent updates such as 1.2.4, 1.3.0, 1.3.1, and so forth, as long as the major version (the first number) remains the same.

The Company does not warrant or guarantee that updates to subsequent major versions (for example, version 2.x.x) will be provided to you.

### 1.5.3 Unauthorized Exploitation

The Company shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from or related to the unauthorized access to, compromise of, or tampering with the Products, whether such unauthorized access is the result of hacking, reverse engineering, circumvention of security measures, or any other form of exploitation by you or any third parties.

This provision applies in circumstances where a third party gains unauthorized access to, or circumvents, restrictions or limitations intended solely for the benefit of the Purchase Agreement, Offer, Quote, Account, Tier granted to you.

No audio is transfered to our servers.
No other type of information about the audio content is transfered or held on our servers.

We'll never sell or exchange your personal information to third parties in any manner.

We won't use your name or company's name in marketing statements without your written permission.

### 1.6.2 Billing information

If you sign up for any of our paid Products, you will be asked to provide your payment information and billing address.
We store a record of the payment transaction, including the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of Account history, invoicing, and billing support.

### 1.6.3 Voluntary correspondence

When you spontaneously e-mail us with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including your e-mail address, so that we have a history of past correspondence to reference if you reach out in the future.

All usage metrics unrelated to billing are subject to complete anonymization. No hashing or similar techniques that could result in pseudonymization are employed. Any information that could reasonably permit the identification of a user, directly or indirectly, is fully and irrevocably removed from such usage metrics, thereby precluding any possibility of re-identification or association with any individual user or account.

This anonymized information is used to drive usage statistics, spot issues, and improve our Products.

### 1.6.5 Retention of Personal Information for Legal Purposes

Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is your sole responsibility to ensure that these components are updated on your systems in order to benefit from the latest security enhancements. The Company disclaims any obligation or ability to perform such updates on your behalf.

Violations can be reported by emailing legal@pitchmeld.ing and must include detailed and concrete information about the Account, the content or behavior you are reporting, and how you found it, including URLs or screenshots.

## 2.1 Account, Ownership and Legal Responsibility

Upon purchasing a license or signing up on our Website, an Account is created for you and you are designated as the legal owner of said Account.

By default, an Account is owned by an individual, not by an organization.

The Account may be managed by you directly or by a third-party designated by you. Notwithstanding such delegation of management responsibilities, you shall remain the sole legal responsible party for the Account.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of any Account you manage and for ensuring that any user of your Account do the same. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

Please create a separate Account for each legal entity you work with.

### 2.1.1 Transfer

By default, our legal responsibility is to the account owner, so we won't let other people take over your account without your permission.

However, if you own an account for the sole purpose of a work of an organisation (a company, a society, an association, a fondation, etc.), our legal responsibility is to the organisation. Upon reception of the necessary document provided by your organisation, we might transfer your account to another individual of the same organisation without your permission.

### 2.1.2 Start and end dates

The Start date is the date when you first used any of our Products.

The End date is the date when your license has been cancelled (no matter how it has been cancelled).

### 2.1.3 Suspension

Suspension means you and any other linked users will not be able to use any Product.

Once an Account entered a status of Suspension, you might re-enable your subscription within 6 months. Past this delay, your Account will be scheduled for cancellation.

### 2.1.4 Cancellation

If not done automatically through Suspension, you are responsible for properly cancelling your account.

If you need help cancelling your account, you can always reach us at <support@pitchmeld.ing>

If you use a Subscriber Account, and you only cancel your payment method before the end of your current paid up period, you will not be charged again and the account will be suspended at the end of your current paid up period.
However, if you cancel your account before the end of your current paid up period, the Products will be suspended **immediately**. We do not automatically prorate unused time in the last billing period.

### 2.1.5 Deletion

After cancellation (no matter how it was canceled), within 60 days, all data we might own will be permanently deleted from our active systems logs and backups. We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently deleted.

There are three exceptions to the retention periods above:

* Tax and other administrative laws might force us to keep some data for up to 18 months. We will always do our best to delete this type of information as soon as possible.

* Data that has any value for handling any dispute or litigation might be held as long as necessary (see Section 1.6.5).

* Fully anonymized information (see Section 1.6.4).

### 2.1.6 Termination

If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account, without notice and without compensation.

You may Terminate the License at any time through the Cancellation and Deletion process (Sec. 2.2.4 and 2.2.5).

A Termination implies an immmediate Cancellation process followed by a Deletion process.

Upon termination, you must immediately cease using our Products.

## 2.2 Payments and trial periods

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties.

### 2.2.1 One-off payments

By purchasing through a One-off payment, the provisions of this Section shall be binding upon you.

You expressly acknowledge and agree to waive your right of withdrawal as provided under EU European Directive 2011/83 (14-day cooling-off period).

No refunds shall be available for purchases made through One-off payments.

We do so because we consider there are way enough means to test our Products and your decision to chose a one-off payment should be final.

### 2.2.2 Periodic payments for Subscriber Accounts

By purchasing through a Subscription, the provisions of this Section shall be binding upon you.

Due to the nature of the product, the Company does not offer refunds. If you truly believe you are owed a refund, you can contact us at <support@pitchmeld.ing>

Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites.

### 2.2.3 Trial periods

At the end of any free trial period you may be using, either of the two will happen:

* The account will be charged according to the user's chosen subscription.

* The account will be Suspended until upgraded to a paid version.
