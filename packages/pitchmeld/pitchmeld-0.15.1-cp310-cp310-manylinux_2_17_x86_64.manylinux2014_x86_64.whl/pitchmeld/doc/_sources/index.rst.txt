Pitchmeld documentation
========================

Pitchmeld is a python package dedicated to **voice/speech processing**.

Features
--------

* High audio quality
* Blazing fast
* Super lightweight (can process hours long recordings without blowing up memory)
* Fully tested (unit tests and audio regression tests)
* Minimal dependencies (only numpy>=1.0)
* Everything runs locally on your machine (no audio stream is sent to the cloud)
* Neutral parameter leads to resynthesis identical to the original signal
* Not introducing delays
* No time drifting

.. note::
   It assumes the signal is *monophonic*, like voice, speech, singing, a flute, a violin, a saxophone, etc.

   It is *not* recommended to use it on polyphonic signals like a piano, a guitar, a drum set, etc.


Dependencies and compatibility
------------------------------

* `numpy>=1.0 <https://numpy.org/>`_ is the only package that will be installed along the pitchmeld package.
* Python 3.9+ (please ask for lower versions if needed, not <=2.7 though).
* Linux or Mac operating system.
* 64bit architecture.
* Network connectivity is required to validate a license key (`status page <https://status.pitchmeld.ing/>`_).
