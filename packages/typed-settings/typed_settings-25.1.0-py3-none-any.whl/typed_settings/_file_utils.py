    Search for a file in the current directory and its parents and return its
    path.

    If the file cannot be found until *stop_dir* is reached or a directory
    contains *stop_file*, return the input *filename*.

    Args:
        filename: The name of the file to find.
        stop_dir: Stop searching if the current search dir equals this one.
        stop_files: Stop searching if the current search dir contains
         this file.
        start_dir: Start directory for the search, defaults to the current directory.

    Returns:
        The resolved path to *filename* if found, else ``Path(filename)``.

    Examples:
        Find :file:`settings.toml` until the root of the current directory
        is reached::

            find("settings.py")

        Find :file:`pyproject.toml` only in the current Git project::

            find("pyproject.toml", stop_file=".git")

       Added the *start_dir* parameter.
