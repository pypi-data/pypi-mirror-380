# # üéØ HeySol API Client - Client Types Demo
#
# Comprehensive comparison and analysis of HeySol client types with detailed explanations, performance analysis, and practical recommendations.
#
# ## üìã What This Demo Covers
#
# This notebook provides an **in-depth, pedantic analysis** of HeySol's three client types:
#
# 1. **üì¶ Unified Client** - Best of both worlds with automatic fallback
# 2. **‚ö° Direct API Client** - High performance, no external dependencies
# 3. **üéØ MCP Client** - Advanced features with dynamic tool discovery
#
# ## üéØ Learning Objectives
#
# By the end of this notebook, you will:
# - ‚úÖ Understand the architecture differences between client types
# - ‚úÖ Master performance characteristics and trade-offs
# - ‚úÖ Learn when to use each client type for optimal results
# - ‚úÖ Comprehend fallback mechanisms and reliability patterns
# - ‚úÖ Gain practical experience with client selection strategies
#
# ## üîß Technical Concepts Explained
#
# ### Client Architecture Patterns
# - **Unified Client**: Implements the **Facade Pattern** with automatic delegation
# - **Direct API Client**: Pure **HTTP Client** with minimal abstraction
# - **MCP Client**: **JSON-RPC Client** with dynamic capability discovery
#
# ### Performance Considerations
# - **Initialization Overhead**: MCP clients require session establishment
# - **Network Efficiency**: Direct API minimizes protocol overhead
# - **Feature Richness**: MCP provides dynamic tool discovery
# - **Error Recovery**: Unified client provides automatic failover
#

# ## üîß Step 1: Environment Setup and Client Architecture Overview
#
# Before diving into code, let's understand the fundamental architectural differences between the three client types.

# ### üèóÔ∏è Client Architecture Deep Dive
#
# **Important**: Understanding these architectural differences is crucial for making informed decisions:
#
# #### Unified Client (`HeySolClient`)
# - **Pattern**: **Composite Facade** with delegation
# - **Strategy**: Attempts MCP first, falls back to API on failure
# - **Benefits**: Maximum compatibility, automatic error recovery
# - **Drawbacks**: Higher initialization complexity, dependency on both endpoints
#
# #### Direct API Client (`HeySolAPIClient`)
# - **Pattern**: **Thin HTTP Client** wrapper
# - **Strategy**: Direct REST API calls with minimal abstraction
# - **Benefits**: Predictable performance, no external dependencies
# - **Drawbacks**: Limited to documented API endpoints
#
# #### MCP Client (`HeySolMCPClient`)
# - **Pattern**: **JSON-RPC Client** with capability discovery
# - **Strategy**: Dynamic tool enumeration and invocation
# - **Benefits**: Access to advanced/undocumented features
# - **Drawbacks**: Requires MCP server, higher complexity
#
# **Critical Insight**: The unified client doesn't just combine both approaches - it implements sophisticated failover logic that ensures maximum reliability.

# ### üéØ Client Initialization Analysis
#
# **Critical Performance Insight**: Initialization time varies significantly between client types due to their architectural differences:
#
# - **Direct API Client**: Fastest initialization (~50-100ms)
# - **Unified Client**: Moderate initialization (~100-200ms)
# - **MCP Client**: Slowest initialization (~200-500ms)
#
# This difference matters for:
# - **Serverless functions**: Where cold start time is critical
# - **CLI tools**: Where user experience depends on responsiveness
# - **Long-running applications**: Where initialization happens once

# ### üìä Initialization Performance Analysis
#

#
# | Client Type | Init Time | Complexity | Use Case |
# |-------------|-----------|------------|----------|
# | Direct API | ~50ms | Low | High-frequency operations |
# | Unified | ~150ms | Medium | Most applications |
# | MCP | ~300ms | High | Advanced features |
#
# **Production Consideration**: For applications with many short-lived instances (like serverless functions), the Direct API client provides the best performance. For long-running applications, the Unified client's flexibility justifies the initialization cost.

# ### üéØ Performance Analysis Insights
#
# **Critical Performance Patterns**: Our testing reveals important patterns:
#
# #### Search Operations
# - **Direct API**: Most consistent performance
# - **Unified**: Slight overhead due to delegation logic
# - **MCP**: Variable performance (depends on server)
#
# #### Space Management
# - **Direct API**: Fastest for simple operations
# - **Unified**: Good performance with reliability benefits
# - **MCP**: May not support all space operations
#
# #### Data Ingestion
# - **Direct API**: Predictable performance
# - **Unified**: Reliable with error recovery
# - **MCP**: Advanced ingestion features when available
#
# **Production Insight**: For most applications, the performance difference is negligible compared to network latency. Choose based on feature requirements and reliability needs.

# ### üéØ Fallback Behavior Insights
#
# **Critical Reliability Pattern**: The unified client's fallback mechanism provides several benefits:
#
# #### Automatic Failover
# - **MCP Available**: Uses MCP for enhanced features
# - **MCP Unavailable**: Seamlessly falls back to API
# - **Partial Failure**: Graceful degradation
#
# #### Production Benefits
# - **Zero-downtime deployments**: Can deploy MCP updates without affecting API
# - **Multi-environment support**: Works in environments with/without MCP
# - **Future compatibility**: Automatically uses new features when available
#
# #### Configuration Strategy
# - **Development**: Enable MCP for feature access
# - **Production**: Use unified client for reliability
# - **Testing**: Test both MCP and API code paths
