Test Configuration for HeySol API Client

This file contains minimal pytest configuration following coding standards:
- Unit Tests Only: Test individual functions, no integration tests
- No Mocks: Test real code, no stubs or mocks
- Fail Fast: Tests must fail on any deviation from expected behavior
"""

# No imports, no fixtures, no mocks, no external dependencies
# Tests should be self-contained and test individual functions directly
