# Json Preprocessor\'s Package Description

## Getting Started

The **JsonPreprocessor** is a Python3 package which allows programmers
to handle additional features in JSON files such as

-   add comments
-   import other json files
-   overwrite already existing parameters with new values

These JSON files will be handled by the **JsonPreprocessor** which
returns as result a dictionary object of the deserialized data.

## How to install

The **JsonPreprocessor** can be installed in two different ways.

1.  Installation via PyPi (recommended for users)

    ``` 
    pip install JsonPreprocessor
    ```

    [JsonPreprocessor in
    PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/JsonPreprocessor/)

2.  Installation via GitHub (recommended for developers)

    -   Clone the **JsonPreprocessor** repository to your machine.

        ``` 
        git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-jsonpreprocessor.git
        ```

        GitHub](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-jsonpreprocessor)

    -   Install dependencies

        **JsonPreprocessor** requires some additional Python libraries.
        Before you install the cloned repository sources you have to
        install the dependencies manually. The names of all related
        packages you can find in the file `requirements.txt` in the
        repository root folder. Use pip to install them:

        ``` 
        pip install -r ./requirements.txt
        ```

        Additionally install **LaTeX** (recommended: TeX Live). This is
        used to render the documentation.

    -   Configure dependencies

        The installation of **JsonPreprocessor** includes to generate
        the documentation in PDF format. This is done by an application
        called **GenPackageDoc**, that is part of the installation
        dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).

        **GenPackageDoc** uses **LaTeX** to generate the documentation
        in PDF format. Therefore **GenPackageDoc** needs to know where
        to find **LaTeX**. This is defined in the **GenPackageDoc**
        configuration file

        ``` 
        packagedoc\packagedoc_config.json
        ```

        Before you start the installation you have to introduce the
        following environment variable, that is used in
        `packagedoc_config.json`:

        -   `GENDOC_LATEXPATH` : path to `pdflatex` executable

    -   Use the following command to install **JsonPreprocessor**:

        ``` 
        setup.py install
        ```
