# kdot-mustard
Blown away by the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show? Wondering how you can get more sweet, pungent, yellowish condiment-based goodness?

Simply fire up ```kdot-mustard```,
```
pip install kdot
```

load up one of our three curated commands,
```python
from kdot_mustard import kdot, kdot_simple, kdot_example

kdot(src_path, target_path, loop, frames, duration) # for total control over what goes on the beat
kdot_simple(src_path) # fast and easy results to turn his TV off
kdot_example() # if you need a demonstration of syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
```

and you have your very own Mr. Morales jumpscare:
