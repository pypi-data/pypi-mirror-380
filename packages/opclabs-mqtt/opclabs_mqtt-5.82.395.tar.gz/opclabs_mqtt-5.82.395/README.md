OpcLabs.Mqtt (NuGet) / opclabs_mqtt (Python)
============================================

The OpcLabs.Mqtt (NuGet) or opclabs_mqtt (Python) package provides MQTT 
communication features for the OPC Labs products, using the System.Net.Mqtt 
library. Its current use is with the OpcLabs.QuickOpc / opclabs_quickopc 
package for OPC UA PubSub transport protocol mappings based on MQTT.

In most cases, it is recommended that you rather use the OpcLabs.MqttNet / 
opclabs_mqttnet package which is based on a different library and has more 
features.
