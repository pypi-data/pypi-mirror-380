features:
  - |
    The ``image_meta`` metadata structure for compute meters was
    formerly only available via the notification meters. When using
    Nova 2025.2 Flamingo or later, ``image_meta`` is now also supplied by
    the compute pollsters. This is now possible due to the addition of
    the relevant metadata to the libvirt guest XML.
  - |
    The built-in ``meters.yaml`` has been updated to publish the
    ``image_meta`` metadata attribute for compute notification meter
    samples by default.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``meters.yaml`` has been updated to add ``image_meta`` to compute meter
    samples by default.
  - |
    In order for the new image metadata attributes to start being populated
    from libvirt metadata in pollster samples, Nova must be upgraded to
    2025.2 Flamingo or later (older versions are still backwards compatible,
    but the new attributes will not be available via pollster samples).
    Existing instances will need to be shelved-and-unshelved or cold migrated
    for the metadata to be populated.
