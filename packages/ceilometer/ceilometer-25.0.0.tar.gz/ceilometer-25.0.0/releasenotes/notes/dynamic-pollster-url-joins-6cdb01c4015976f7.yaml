    When using dynamic pollsters to query OpenStack APIs, if the endpoint URL
    returned by Keystone does not have a trailing slash and ``url_path`` is
    a relative path, the ``url_path`` configured in the dynamic pollster would
    replace sections of the endpoint URL instead of being appended to the end
    of the URL. This behaviour has now been changed so that ``url_path``
    values that do not start with a ``/`` are always appended to the end of
    endpoint URLs.
    This change may require existing dynamic pollsters that rely on this
    behaviour to be changed, but this allows dynamic pollsters to be added
    for OpenStack services that append the active project ID to the API
    endpoint URL (e.g. Trove).
