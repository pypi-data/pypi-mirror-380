    A ``map`` event trait plugin has been added.
    This allows notification meter attributes to be created
    by mapping one set of values from an attribute to another
    set of values defined in the meter definition.
    Additional options are also available for controlling
    how to handle edge cases, such as unknown values and
    case sensitivity.
