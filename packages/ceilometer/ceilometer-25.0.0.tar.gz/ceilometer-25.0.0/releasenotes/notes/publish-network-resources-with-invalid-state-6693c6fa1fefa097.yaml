upgrade:

    The ``ip.floating`` and ``network.services.vpn`` pollsters now publish
    samples for all found floating IPs and VPNs, even if they are known
    to have an unknown state, when they would previously be dropped.
    The volume of samples for such floating IPs and VPNs will be set to
    ``-1``.
    This improves visibility of floating IPs and VPNs with unknown states,
    allowing them to be monitored via samples and the Gnocchi metrics,
    making it easier to discover such resources for troubleshooting.
    It also moves some of the "business logic" for downstream rating/billing
    services such as CloudKitty out of Ceilometer itself.

    The ``network.services.vpn`` now publishes samples for VPNs with
    status ``ERROR``, when they would previously be dropped.
    The sample volume for VPNs in ``ERROR`` state is ``7``.
