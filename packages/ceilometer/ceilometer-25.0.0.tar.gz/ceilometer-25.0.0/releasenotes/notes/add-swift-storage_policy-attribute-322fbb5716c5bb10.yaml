features:
  - |
    The ``storage_policy`` resource metadata attribute has been added to the
    ``swift.containers.objects`` and ``swift.containers.objects.size`` meters,
    populated from already performed Swift account ``GET`` requests.
    This functionality requires using a new version of Swift that adds the
    ``storage_policy`` attribute when listing containers in an account.
    Ceilometer is backwards compatible with Swift versions that do not
    provide this functionality, but ``storage_policy`` will be set to
    ``None`` in samples and Gnocchi resources.
  - |
    An optional ``storage_policy`` attribute has been added to the
    ``swift_account`` Gnocchi resource type, to store the storage policy for
    Swift containers in Gnocchi. For Swift accounts, ``storage_policy`` will
    be set to ``None``.
upgrade:
  - |
    To publish the ``storage_policy`` attribute for Swift containers,
    ``gnocchi_resources.yaml`` will need to be updated to the latest version.
    Swift in the target OpenStack cloud will also need upgrading to add
    support for providing the storage policy when listing containers.
