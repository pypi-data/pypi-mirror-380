"""This module contains the HandleTask class, which serves as an abstract base class for handling tasks based on task objects.

It provides a structured mechanism for asynchronous task execution by leveraging code drafting and execution workflows.
The class facilitates interaction with various tools, managing their execution lifecycle and workflow.
