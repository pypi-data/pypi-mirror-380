class IRequester(IFactory, ABC):
    """
    Abstract base interface for HTTP requesters with comprehensive configuration and error handling.

    This abstract class defines the standard interface for all HTTP requester implementations
    in the core_https library. It provides a factory pattern for creating requester instances,
    comprehensive parameter validation, encoding detection, and standardized exception mapping.

    All concrete implementations must inherit from this class and implement the abstract
    methods: engine() and request(). The class supports various HTTP libraries through
    a pluggable architecture while maintaining consistent behavior and error handling.

    Features:
        - Factory pattern for requester instantiation
        - Comprehensive parameter validation with clear error messages
        - Automatic encoding detection from HTTP response headers
        - Standardized HTTP exception mapping (401â†’AuthenticationException, etc.)
        - Configurable connection pooling and timeouts
        - Support for retry strategies and backoff factors

    Parameters:
        encoding: Character encoding for response decoding. Defaults to "utf-8".
            Must be a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.

        raise_for_status: Whether to automatically raise exceptions for HTTP error status codes.
            When True, 4xx and 5xx responses will raise appropriate exceptions.

        retries: Retry strategy configuration. Can be an integer for simple retry counts
            or a library-specific retry object (e.g., urllib3.util.retry.Retry).
            Different implementations may handle this parameter differently.

        backoff_factor: Exponential backoff multiplier between retry attempts.
            Must be non-negative. The actual delay is typically: backoff_factor * attempt_number.

        connector_limit: Maximum number of connections in the connection pool.
            Must be positive and greater than or equal to connector_limit_per_host.

        connector_limit_per_host: Maximum connections per individual host.
            Must be positive and cannot exceed connector_limit.

        timeout: Request timeout in seconds. Must be positive and should not exceed 3600 seconds.
            Individual requests may override this value based on implementation.

        Initialize the HTTP requester with validated configuration parameters.

        This constructor performs comprehensive validation on all input parameters
        to ensure they meet the required constraints. Invalid parameters will
        raise ValueError with descriptive error messages.

        Args:
            encoding: Character encoding for response decoding. Must be a non-empty
                string after stripping whitespace. Defaults to "utf-8".
                Common values: "utf-8", "iso-8859-1", "windows-1252".

            raise_for_status: Whether to automatically raise exceptions for HTTP
                error status codes. When True, responses with 4xx or 5xx status
                codes will raise appropriate exceptions instead of returning normally.

            retries: Retry strategy configuration. Can be None (no retries),
                an integer (simple retry count), or a library-specific retry
                object (e.g., urllib3.util.retry.Retry). Different implementations
                may interpret this parameter differently.

            backoff_factor: Exponential backoff multiplier for retry delays.
                Must be non-negative. The actual delay between retries is typically
                calculated as: backoff_factor * attempt_number seconds.
                Use None to disable backoff delays.

            connector_limit: Maximum number of concurrent connections in the
                connection pool. Must be positive and >= connector_limit_per_host.
                Higher values allow more concurrent requests but use more resources.

            connector_limit_per_host: Maximum concurrent connections per individual
                host/domain. Must be positive and <= connector_limit. This prevents
                overwhelming any single server with too many concurrent connections.

            timeout: Default request timeout in seconds. Must be positive and
                should not exceed 3600 seconds (1 hour). Individual requests may
                override this value depending on the implementation.
