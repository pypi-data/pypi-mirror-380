///
/// For faster iteration we'll start with an in-memory data structure that
/// represents the bytecode instead of real binary instructions since getting
/// those to work correctly is much harder (unsafe Rust, pointer arithmetic).
///
/// We do need to respect some sort of "instruction format" however. In
/// stack-based VMs some instructions don't take any arguments (for example,
/// the `ADD` instruction would grab its operands from the evaluation stack),
/// but some others such as `LOAD_CONST` need to know which constant to load,
/// so they take an unsigned integer as an argument (the index of the constant
/// in the constant pool). Same goes for jump instructions, we need to know the
/// offset.
///
/// We are not limited to one single argument, we can have variable-length
/// instructions in the VM, but we do have to keep the arguments limited to
/// "bytes" (unsigned integers, signed integers, etc). Use the arguments to
/// index into runtime structures such as constant pools, object pools, etc.
/// Don't embed complex data structures in an instruction. Avoid this:
///
/// ```ignore
/// enum Instruction {
///     MySuperDuperInstruction(HashMap<String, Vec<Function>>)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Instead store the state or complex structure in the [`crate::Vm`] struct and
/// find a way to reference it with very simple instructions.
