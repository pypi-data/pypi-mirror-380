features:
  - |
    The new ``[task_flow] jobboard_backend_username`` option has been added, to
    support Redis ACL feature.

    Previously, redis jobboard driver used only the first host in
    ``[task_flow] jobboard_backend_hosts`` when connecting to Redis Sentinel.
    Now the driver attempts the other hosts as fallbacks.
