    Added a validation step in the batch member API request that checks if a
    member is included multiple times in the list of updated members, this
    additional check prevents the load balancer from being stuck in
    PENDING_UPDATE. Duplicate members in the batch member flow triggered an
    exception in Taskflow.
    The API now returns 400 (ValidationException) if a member is already
    present in the body of the request.
