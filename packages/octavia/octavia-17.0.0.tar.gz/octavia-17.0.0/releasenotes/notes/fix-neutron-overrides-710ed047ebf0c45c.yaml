    Fixed a bug when the deprecated settings (``endpoint``, ``endpoint_type``,
    ``ca_certificates_file``) are used in the ``[neutron]`` section of the
    configuration file. The connection to the neutron service may have used
    some settings from the ``[service_auth]`` section or used undefined
    settings.
