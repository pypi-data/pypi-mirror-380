class ReportingReader:
    """
    Utility wrapper used for reporting on the progress of reading a file.

    The ReportingReader can be used as a normal file-like object. The main
    difference with a general file-like object is that each time "read" is
    called the read progress is printed to the console.

    For example, to report the progress of uploading a file you can use:

        with ReportingReader(massive_file_path) as local_file:
            requests.post(url, data=local_file)

    This will use the default streaming uploads capability of requests to
    upload a file, but displays the upload progress on the terminal.
