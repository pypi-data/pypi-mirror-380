upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated ``[placement]/policy_file`` configuration option is removed
    Use the more standard ``[oslo_policy]/policy_file`` config option. If you
    do not override policy with custom rules you will have nothing to do. If
    you do override the placement default policy then you will need to update
    your configuration to use the ``[oslo_policy]/policy_file`` config option.
