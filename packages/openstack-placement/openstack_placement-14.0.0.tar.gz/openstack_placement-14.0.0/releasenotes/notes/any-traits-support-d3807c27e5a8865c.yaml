    Microversion 1.39 adds support for the ``in:`` syntax in the ``required``
    query parameter in the ``GET /resource_providers`` API as well as to the
    ``required`` and ``requiredN`` query params of the
    ``GET /allocation_candidates`` API. Also adds support for repeating the
    ``required`` and ``requiredN`` parameters in the respective APIs. So::

      required=in:T3,T4&required=T1,!T2

    is supported and it means T1 and not T2 and (T3 or T4).
