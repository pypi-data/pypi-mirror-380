    Microversion 1.38 adds support for a ``consumer_type`` (required) key in
    the request body of ``POST /allocations``, ``PUT
    /allocations/{consumer_uuid}`` and in the response of ``GET
    /allocations/{consumer_uuid}``. ``GET /usages`` requests gain a
    ``consumer_type`` key as an optional query parameter to filter usages based
    on consumer_types. ``GET /usages`` response will group results based on the
    consumer type and will include a new ``consumer_count`` key per type
    irrespective of whether the ``consumer_type`` was specified in the request.
    If an ``all`` ``consumer_type`` key is provided, all results are grouped
    under one key, ``all``. Older allocations which were not created with a
    consumer type are considered to have an ``unknown`` ``consumer_type``.  If
    an ``unknown`` ``consumer_type`` key is provided, all results are grouped
    under one key, ``unknown``.

    The corresponding changes to ``POST /reshaper`` are included.
