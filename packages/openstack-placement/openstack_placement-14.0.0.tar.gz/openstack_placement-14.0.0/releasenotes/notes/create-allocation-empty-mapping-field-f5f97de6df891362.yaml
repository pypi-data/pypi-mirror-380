    Since microversion 1.34, it has been possible to provide a ``mappings``
    field when creating new allocations via the ``POST /allocations`` or ``PUT
    /allocations/{allocation_id}`` APIs. This field should be a a dictionary
    associating request group suffixes with a list of UUIDs identifying the
    resource providers that satisfied each group. Due to a typo, this was
    allowing an empty object (``{}``). This is now corrected.
