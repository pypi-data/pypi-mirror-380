# dcmspec

## Overview

**dcmspec** is a versatile **Python toolkit** designed to provide processing of DICOM<sup>®</sup> specifications such as the DICOM standard or IHE profiles.

Designed as a general-purpose, extensible framework, **dcmspec** enables flexible extraction, parsing, and processing of DICOM specifications.

## Features

- An API to programmatically access, parse, and process DICOM and IHE specifications.
- Command-Line Interface (CLI) sample scripts which extract, parse, and process specific DICOM and IHE specifications.
- User Interface (UI) sample application for interactive exploration of DICOM IODs.

> **Note:** CLI and UI sample applications are provided as developer examples and are not intended to be full-featured or production-grade applications.

## Installation

To install the core package:

```bash
pip install dcmspec
```

For information on installing optional features (UI sample, PDF parsing), see the [Installation Guide](https://dwikler.github.io/dcmspec/installation/).

## Quick Start

This example downloads and prints the DICOM Patient Module table as a tree:

```python
from dcmspec.spec_factory import SpecFactory
from dcmspec.spec_printer import SpecPrinter

patient_module = SpecFactory().create_model(
    url="https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part03.html",
    table_id="table_C.7-1",
    cache_file_name="Part3.xhtml",
    json_file_name="patient_module.json",
)

SpecPrinter(patient_module).print_tree(
    attr_names=["elem_tag", "elem_type", "elem_name"], attr_widths=[11, 2, 64]
)
```

> **Note:**  
> The first time you run this, the full DICOM Part 3 HTML file (~30MB) will be downloaded and parsed. Subsequent runs will use the cached file and be much faster.

## Similar Projects

There are a few great related open source projects worth checking out:

- [innolitics/dicom-standard](https://github.com/innolitics/dicom-standard): Tools and data for parsing and working with the DICOM standard in a structured format.
- [pydicom/dicom-validator](https://github.com/pydicom/dicom-validator): A DICOM file validator based on the DICOM standard.

**How dcmspec differs:**

- The above projects focus on parsing specific sections of the DICOM standard to support targeted use cases, such as browsing or validation.
- **dcmspec** is designed with a broader scope. It provides a flexible framework for parsing any DICOM specification document, including the DICOM Standard itself, DICOM Conformance Statements, and IHE Integration Profiles.
- The object-oriented architecture of **dcmspec** is extensible, making it possible to support additional sources, and to define custom structured data models as output.
