Example usage:

    >>> from eu_cbm_hat.core.continent import continent
    >>> runner = continent.combos['reference_cable_pop'].runners['EE'][-1]
    >>> runner.num_timesteps = 2070 - runner.country.inventory_start_year
    >>> # Check availability of the raw growth multiplier table
    >>> runner.clim_adjust.df
    >>> output = runner.run(keep_in_ram=True, verbose=True, interrupt_on_error=True)

    >>> from eu_cbm_hat.core.continent import continent
    >>> runner = continent.combos['reference'].runners['LU'][-1]
    >>> runner.num_timesteps = 2070 - runner.country.inventory_start_year
    >>> output = runner.run(keep_in_ram=True, verbose=True, interrupt_on_error=True)

Inside libcbm's C++ code from the `libcbm_c` repository, we can see where the
growth multiplier is applied inside `src/cbm/cbmbiomassdynamics.cpp`.

There are two multiplications by growth multipliers:

1. one multiplication in GetTotalBiomassIncrement
    - total_increment.SWM = SWM_inc * sw_multiplier;
    - total_increment.HWM = HWM_inc * hw_multiplier;

2. another multiplication in GetGrowthMatrix

```
Biomass inc = GetTotalBiomassIncrement(biomass,
    agBiomassIncrement,
    growthMult.SoftwoodMultiplier * growth_multiplier,
    growthMult.HardwoodMultiplier * growth_multiplier);
```

What is the difference between `growthMult.SoftwoodMultiplier`,
`growth_multiplier` and `sw_multiplier` ?

1. growthMult.SoftwoodMultiplier is a Species and disturbance-specific
adjustment factor retrieved from parameter tables via
`_Parameters.GetGrowthMultipliers(lastDisturbancetype,
growth_multiplier_step)`. It is based on `lastDisturbancetype (e.g., fire,
harvest, insect damage)` and `growth_multiplier_step (likely time since
disturbance)`. It represents how the specific disturbance history affects
softwood growth rates.

2. `growth_multiplier` is an overall growth scaling factor (for climate/site
productivity) passed as a parameter through the cbm_vars.state data frame. It represents
broad environmental conditions affecting all growth such as Climate conditions
(temperature, precipitation), Site quality, COâ‚‚ fertilization effects.

3. `sw_multiplier` is calculated as the product of the above two.
`sw_multiplier = growthMult.SoftwoodMultiplier * growth_multiplier`. It
represents the Total growth adjustment combining both disturbance effects AND
environmental conditions.

        This is in contrast to the CBM variables used in `dynamics_func` of
        cbm/dynamic.py. The `stands` data frame in `dynamics_func` is a
        concatenation of the classifiers, parameters, inventory, state, flux
