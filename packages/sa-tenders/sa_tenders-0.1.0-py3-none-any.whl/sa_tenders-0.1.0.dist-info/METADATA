This library, `sa_tenders`, simplifies the process of downloading data from the South African e-tenders platform. More specifically, 
the package enables developers to download, process and export e-tenders data.


**Quickstart:**

*Installing*

<code> pip install sa_tenders</code>

*A simple example:*
```
from sa_tenders import sa_tenders

#initiating the class
source = sa_tenders(page_size=100, start_date="2024-01-01", end_date="2024-12-31")

#calling some of the class attributes
meta_data = source.meta_data
raw_data = source.raw_data_dict
clean_data = source.cleaned_dataframe

#printing the results
for i in [meta_data, raw_data, clean_data]:
    print(i)

#exporting the clean data to excel
clean_data.to_excel("sa_tenders_data.xlsx")
```
