### What is Retab?

Retab solves all the major challenges in document processing with Large Language Models:

1. **Universal Document Preprocessing**: Convert any file type (PDFs, Excel, emails, etc.) into LLM-ready format without writing custom parsers
2. **Structured, Schema-driven Extraction**: Get consistent, reliable outputs using schema-based prompt engineering
3. **Processors**: Publish a live, stable, shareable document processor.
4. **Automations**: Create document processing workflows that can be triggered by events (mailbox, upload link, endpoint, outlook plugin).
5. **Projects**: Evaluate the performance of models against annotated datasets
6. **Optimizations**: Identify the most used processors and help you finetune models to reduce costs and improve performance

We are offering you all the software-defined primitives to build your own document processing solutions. We see it as **Stripe** for document processing.

Our goal is to make the process of analyzing documents and unstructured data as **easy** and **transparent** as possible.

**A new, lighter paradigm**
Large Language Models collapse entire layers of legacy OCR pipelines into a single, elegant abstraction. When a model can read, reason, and structure text natively, we no longer need brittle heuristics, handcrafted parsers, or heavyweight ETL jobs. Instead, we can expose a small, principled API: "give me the document, tell me the schema, and get back structured truth." Complexity evaporates, reliability rises, speed follows, and costs fall‚Äîbecause every component you remove is one that can no longer break. LLM‚Äëfirst design lets us focus less on plumbing and more on the questions we actually want answered.

Many people haven't yet realized how powerful LLMs have become at document processing tasks - we're here to help **unlock these capabilities**.
