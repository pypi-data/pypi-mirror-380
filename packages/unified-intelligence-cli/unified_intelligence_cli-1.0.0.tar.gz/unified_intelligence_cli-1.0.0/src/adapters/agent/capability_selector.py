        Calculate how well an agent's capabilities match a task.

        Uses fuzzy string matching (difflib.SequenceMatcher) to find similarity
        between task description words and agent capabilities.

        Algorithm:
        1. Tokenize task description into words
        2. For each word, find the best-matching capability using string similarity
        3. Sum all matches that exceed the 0.8 similarity threshold
        4. Return total score (higher = better match)

        Example:
            Task: "Write tests for the API"
            Agent capabilities: ["test", "testing", "qa"]
            - "write" matches nothing (< 0.8 threshold)
            - "tests" matches "testing" (0.889) â†’ count
            - "for" matches nothing
            - "the" matches nothing
            - "api" matches nothing
            Total score: 0.889
