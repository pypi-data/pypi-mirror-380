### ✅ Recommendation #2: Enhanced Integration Tests

**Target:** More comprehensive end-to-end testing
**Achieved:** 31 integration tests (+55% from 20)

**Implementation:**
- Added 11 end-to-end CLI integration tests (test_cli_end_to_end.py)
- Tests cover: CLI workflows, config loading, parallel execution, file operations
- Complex scenarios: 20 concurrent tasks, priority handling, agent specialization
- Multi-agent workflows with dependencies

**Results:**
- **Integration tests:** 20 → 31 (+11 tests, +55%)
- Full stack testing from CLI → composition → coordination → execution
- Real file operation workflows tested

**Commits:**
- `cea1014` Test: Add comprehensive end-to-end integration tests (Rec #2 Complete)

---

### ✅ Recommendation #3: Custom Exceptions for Better Error Handling

**Target:** Explicit exception types for tool operations
**Achieved:** Complete exception hierarchy with 17 tests

**Implementation:**
- Created `src/exceptions.py` with base `ToolExecutionError`
- 7 specific exception types:
  - `CommandTimeoutError` (with timeout tracking)
  - `FileSizeLimitError` (with size conversion to MB)
  - `FileNotFoundError` (with path context)
  - `DirectoryNotFoundError` (directory validation)
  - `CommandExecutionError` (execution failures)
  - `FileWriteError` (write failures)
- Updated `tools.py` to raise typed exceptions
- 17 comprehensive exception tests covering inheritance, attributes, messages

**Benefits:**
- Programmatic error handling vs string matching
- Context preservation (paths, sizes, timeouts)
- Maintains LLM tool interface (GrokSession converts to strings)

**Commits:**
- Implemented in initial session (documented in IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md)

---

### ✅ Recommendation #4: Documentation - Inline Comments

**Target:** Document complex algorithms
**Achieved:** Enhanced capability_selector.py with detailed documentation

**Implementation:**
- Added detailed inline comments to `capability_selector.py`
- Documented fuzzy matching algorithm with example
- Step-by-step algorithm breakdown:
  1. Tokenize task description
  2. Find best-matching capability (difflib.SequenceMatcher)
  3. Sum matches above 0.8 threshold
  4. Return total score
- Example showing "tests" matching "testing" (0.889 similarity)
- Threshold rationale explanation (80% similarity)

**Impact:**
- Self-documenting code for complex scoring logic
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
- Clear reasoning for algorithm choices

**Commits:**
- Implemented in initial session (documented in IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md)

---

### ✅ Recommendation #5: Security Audit - Command Whitelist Documentation

**Achieved:** Comprehensive SECURITY.md (464 lines)

**Implementation:**
- Created `SECURITY.md` covering:
  - **Command Execution Security:**
    - Current protections (30s timeout, exception handling)
    - Security trade-offs (full shell access vs whitelist)
    - Whitelist implementation example with bypass scenarios
  - **File Operation Safety:**
    - Size limits (100KB), path validation
    - Dangerous operations documentation
    - Safe usage patterns (workspace isolation)

  - **Best Practices:**
    - Workspace isolation patterns
    - Version control integration
    - Docker/CI-CD security
    - Mock-first testing
  - **Threat Model:**
    - In-scope defenses (timeout, memory, paths)
    - Out-of-scope risks (malicious LLM, credentials)
    - Attack scenarios and mitigations
- Updated README with Security section and link

**Benefits:**
- Clear security model: "Trusted local development"
- Informed decision-making for users
- Production deployment guidelines

**Commits:**
- `015dda5` Doc: Add comprehensive security documentation (Rec #5 Complete)

### ✅ Recommendation #6: Abstract Tool Registration System

**Target:** More extensible tool management
**Achieved:** ToolRegistry class with decorator pattern

**Implementation:**
- Created `src/tool_registry.py` with:
  - `ToolMetadata` dataclass (name, function, description, parameters)
  - `ToolRegistry` class for management:
    - Decorator-based registration (`@registry.register`)
    - Direct registration (`register_function`)
    - Tool introspection (`get_tool`, `get_metadata`, `list_tools`)
    - Tool execution with validation (`execute_tool`)
    - Validation (`validate_tool`)
    - Operator support (`__len__`, `__contains__`, `__repr__`)
  - OpenAI format conversion (`to_openai_format`)
- Updated `src/tools.py` to use registry
- Maintained backward compatibility (`DEV_TOOLS`, `TOOL_FUNCTIONS`)
- 22 comprehensive unit tests for registry

**Benefits:**
- **Open-Closed Principle:** Extend without modifying core
- **Single Responsibility:** Registry only manages tools
- Decorator pattern for easy registration
- Metadata and introspection support

**Example:**
```python
from src.tool_registry import default_registry

@default_registry.register(
    name="my_tool",
    description="Tool description",
    parameters={"x": {"type": "integer"}},
    required=["x"]
)
def my_tool(x: int) -> int:
    return x * 2
```
