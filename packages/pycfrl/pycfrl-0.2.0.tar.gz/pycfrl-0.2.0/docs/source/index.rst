PyCFRL documentation
==================

Welcome to PyCFRL, a Python library for counterfactually fair reinforcement learning! 
The acronym "CFRL" stands for "Counterfactual Fairness in Reinforcement Learning". PyCFRL provides 
algorithms that ensure counterfactual fairness in reinforcement learning and builds tools for 
evaluating the value and counterfactual fairness of reinforcement learning policies. 

*Note: This library was originally named CFRL, but we later changed the name to PyCFRL.*

To install PyCFRL, run 

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pip install pycfrl

This project is still being perfected. We will continue adding new functionalities and expanding 
the use cases of PyCFRL. We appreciate your patience and support!
