        Args: 
            num_actions (int): 
                The total number of legit actions. 
            model_type (str): 
                The type of the model used for learning the Q function. Can 
                be "lm" (polynomial regression) or "nn" (neural network). 
                *Currently, only 'nn' is supported.*
            hidden_dims (list[int], optional): 
                The hidden dimensions of the neural network. This 
                argument is not used if :code:`model_type="lm"`. 
            preprocessor (Preprocessor, optional): 
                A preprocessor used for preprocessing input data 
                before using the data for training or decision-making. The preprocessor must have 
                already been trained if it requires training. When set to :code:`None`, :code:`FQI` 
                will directly use the input data for training or decision-making without 
                preprocessing it.
            gamma (int or float, optional): 
                The discount factor for the cumulative discounted reward 
                in the objective function.
            learning_rate (int or float, optional): 
                The learning rate of the neural network. This 
                argument is not used if :code:`model_type="lm"`. 
            epochs (int, optional): 
                The number of training epochs for the neural network. This 
                argument is not used if :code:`model_type="lm"`. 
            is_loss_monitored (bool, optional):
                When set to :code:`True`, will split the training data into a training set and a 
                validation set, and will monitor the validation loss when training the neural network 
                approximator of the Q function in each iteration. A warning 
                will be raised if the decrease in the validation loss is greater than :code:`min_delta` for at 
                least one of the final :math:`p` epochs during neural network training, where :math:`p` is specified 
                by the argument :code:`patience`. This argument is not used if :code:`model_type="lm"`.
            is_early_stopping (bool, optional): 
                When set to :code:`True`, will split the training data into a training set and a 
                validation set, and will enforce early stopping based on the validation loss 
                when training the neural network approximator of the Q function in each iteration. That is, in each iteration, 
                neural network training will stop early 
                if the decrease in the validation loss is no greater than :code:`min_delta` for :math:`p` consecutive training 
                epochs, where :math:`p` is specified by the argument :code:`patience`. This argument is not used if 
                :code:`model_type="lm"`.
            test_size (int or float, optional): 
                An :code:`int` or :code:`float` between 0 and 1 (inclusive) that 
                specifies the proportion of the full training data that is used as the validation set for loss 
                monitoring and early stopping. This argument is not used if :code:`model_type="lm"` or 
                both :code:`is_loss_monitored` and :code:`is_early_stopping` are :code:`False`.
            patience (int, optional): 
                The number of consequentive epochs with barely-decreasing validation loss that is needed 
                for loss monitoring and early stopping. This argument is not used if :code:`model_type="lm"` 
                or both :code:`is_loss_monitored` and :code:`is_early_stopping` are :code:`False`.
            min_delta (int for float, optional): 
                The maximum amount of decrease in the validation loss for it to be considered 
                barely-decreasing by the loss monitoring and early stopping mechanisms. This argument is

        Make decisions using the `FQI` agent. 

        Important Note when the internal preprocessor is a :code:`SequentialPreprocessor`: A 
        :code:`SequentialPreprocessor` object internally stores the preprocessed counterfactual states 
        from the previous function call using a states buffer, and the stored counterfactual states will 
        be used to preprocess the inputs of the current function call. In this case, suppose :code:`act()` 
        is called on a set of transitions at time :math:`t` in some trajectory. Then, at the next call 
        of :code:`act()` for this instance of `FQI`, the transitions passed to the function must be 
        from time :math:`t+1` of the same trajectory to ensure that the buffer works correctly. 
        To preprocess another trajectory, either use another instance of :code:`FQI`, or pass the 
        initial step of the trajectory to :code:`act()` with :code:`xtm1=None` and :code:`atm1=None` to 
        reset the buffer. 

        Similar issues might also arise when the internal preprocessor is some custom preprocessor 
        that relies on buffers. 

        Args: 
            zs (list or np.ndarray): 
                The observed sensitive attributes of each individual 
                for whom the decisions are to be made. It should be a 2D list or array following 
                the Sensitive Attributes Format.
            xt (list or np.ndarray): 
                The states at the current time step of each individual for whom the decisions 
                are to be made. It should be a 2D list or array following the Single-time States 
                Format.
            xtm1 (list or np.ndarray, optional): 
                The states at the previous time step of each individual  
                for whom the decisions are to be made. It should be a 2D list or array following the 
                Single-time States Format.
            atm1 (list or np.ndarray, optional): 
                The actions at the previous time step of each individual  
                for whom the decisions are to be made. It should be a 1D list or array following the 
                Single-time Actions Format. When both :code:`xtm1` and :code:`atm1` are set to 
                :code:`None`, the agent will consider the input to be from the initial time step of 
                a new trajectory, and the internal preprocessor be reset if it is an instance of 
                :code:`SequentialPreprocessor`.
            uxt (list or np.ndarray, optional): 
                The exogenous variables for each 
                individual's action. It should be a 2D list or array with shape (N, 1) 
                where N is the total number of individuals.

        Returns: 
            actions (np.ndarray): 
                The decisions made for the individuals. It is a 1D array following the 
                Single-time Actions Format.
