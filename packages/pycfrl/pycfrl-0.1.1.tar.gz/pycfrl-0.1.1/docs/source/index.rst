CFRL documentation
==================

Welcome to CFRL, a Python library for counterfactually fair reinforcement learning! 
The acronym "CFRL" stands for "Counterfactual Fairness in Reinforcement Learning". CFRL provides 
algorithms that ensure counterfactual fairness in reinforcement learning and builds tools for 
evaluating the value and counterfactual fairness of reinforcement learning policies. 

To install CFRL, run 

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ pip install cfrl

This project is still being perfected. We will continue adding new functionalities and expanding 
the use cases of CFRL. We appreciate your patience and support!
