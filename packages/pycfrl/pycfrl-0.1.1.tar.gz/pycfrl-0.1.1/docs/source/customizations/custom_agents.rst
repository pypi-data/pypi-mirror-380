Custom Agents
=========================

In addition to :code:`FQI`, users can also define custom decision-making agents and use them 
in CFRL. A custom decision-agent often represents a pre-specified decision rule (e.g. making 
decisions randomly) or implements another reinforcement learning algorithm not provided by CFRL.

To ensure a custom agent is compatible with CFRL, it must inherit from the 
:code:`Agent` class provided by the :code:`agents` module. That is, 

- The custom agent should be a subclass of :code:`Agent`.
- The custom preprocessor should have an :code:`act()` method whose function name, 
  parameter names, parameter data types, parameter default values, and return type are 
  exactly as that defined in the :code:`Agent` class, except that it might have some additional 
  arguments. The input and output lists or arrays should also follow the same 
  :ref:`Trajectory Array format <trajectory_arrays>` or have the same shape as those defined in 
  :code:`Preprocessor`.

For example, though simple, the following :code:`RandomAgent` is a valid custom 
agent that will be compatible with CFRL.

.. code-block:: python

    class RandomAgent(Agent):
        def __init__(self, p: int | float = 0.5) -> None:
            self.p = p

        def act(
            self, 
            z: list | np.ndarray, 
            xt: list | np.ndarray, 
            xtm1: list | np.ndarray | None = None, 
            atm1: list | np.ndarray | None = None, 
            uat: list | np.ndarray | None = None, 
            verbose: bool = False
        ) -> np.ndarray:
            if verbose: 
                print("RandomAgent taking actions...")
            N = np.array(z).shape[0]
            u = np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=N)
            actions = (u < p).astype(int)
            return actions


On the other hand, the following agent will not be compatible with CFRL 
because its :code:`act()` does not have :code:`uat` in its argument list. 
:code:`uat` should be included in the argument list here to ensure 
compatibility even though it is not used in the function.

.. code-block:: python

    class RandomAgent(Agent):
        def __init__(self, p: int | float = 0.5) -> None:
            self.p = p

        def act(
            self, 
            z: list | np.ndarray, 
            xt: list | np.ndarray, 
            xtm1: list | np.ndarray | None = None, 
            atm1: list | np.ndarray | None = None, 
            verbose: bool = False
        ) -> np.ndarray:
            if verbose: 
                print("RandomAgent taking actions...")
            N = np.array(z).shape[0]
            u = np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=N)
            actions = (u < p).astype(int)
            return actions


If an agent is a valid custom agent, then it can be used wherever 
an :code:`FQI` can be used. For example, we can use 
:code:`evaluate_fairness_through_model()` to calculate its counterfactual 
fairness metric.

.. code-block:: python

    # Suppose e is a SimulatedEnvironment object that has already been trained.
    # Also suppose zs, states, actions is a trajectory from the environment 
    # on which e is trained.
    agent = RandomAgent(p=0.2)
    evaluate_fairness_through_model(env=e, 
                                    zs=zs, 
                                    states=states, 
                                    actions=actions, 
                                    policy=agent)
