## Typing stubs for pyserial

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`pyserial`](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `pyserial`. This version of
`types-pyserial` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`pyserial==3.5.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/pyserial`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyserial)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.18.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.405

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`91055c730ffcda6311654cf32d663858ece69bad`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/91055c730ffcda6311654cf32d663858ece69bad).
