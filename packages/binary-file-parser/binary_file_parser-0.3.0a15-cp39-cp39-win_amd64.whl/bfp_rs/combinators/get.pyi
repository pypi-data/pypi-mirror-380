    Fetches the value of a retriever. If the resulting value is an ``int``, it's result can be manipulated with ``int``
    operations. For example, ``get(Struct1.sub_struct1, SubStruct1.sub_list1, 1, SubStruct2.property)+1`` is like doing
    ``struct1.sub_struct1.sub_list1[1].property+1``

        An instance encoding the retriever path and manipulations to perform during parsing

    Fetches the value of a context key. If the resulting value is an ``int``, it's result can be manipulated with ``int``
