    [De]serialize a ``list[list[T]]`` whose length is indicated by a leading ``u8`` followed by that many ``u8``s
    indicating the lengths of each of the nested lists, using the syntax ``StackedArray8[T]``. The length of the outer
    list may be fixed to ``N`` using the syntax ``StackedArray8[N][T]`` which then reads ``N`` ``u8``s to determine
    the lengths of the nested lists.

    For example, ``StackedArray8[bool8]`` will read a ``u8``, followed by that many ``u8``s - the sum of these
    quantities indicates how many total ``bool8``s will be read.

    Essentially, instead of each list's length immediately preceding them, all the lengths for the sub lists are
    specified right at the start after specifying how many sub lists there are
