## How to install it?

`pip install spec2epsilon`

## How to use it?

Once installed, use the command:

`spec2epsilon`

The application will open in your browser.


## Input file

The application requires a .csv file in the format shown below:

```csv
Solvent,epsilon,nr,Molecule_name
CyH,2.0165,1.4262,440
Tol,2.3800,1.4969,463
Diox,2.2099,1.4224,485
EtOAc,6.2530,1.3724,539
THF,7.5800,1.4072,543
CHCl3,4.8100,1.4458,552
Ace,20.700,1.3586,597
DMF,37.219,1.4305,617
PS,,1.5500,465
PMMA,,1.5500,535
Zeonex,,1.5500,449
CBP,,1.5500,504
```

The **solvent** column identifies the solvents and materials where fluorescence has been measured.

The **epsilon** column contains the static dielectric constant for known solvents. 
Rows that include **epsilon** values are used for the characterization of the molecule (calculation of $E_{vac}$ and $\chi$).  
Rows where **epsilon** is missing are interpreted as materials for which the inference procedure will be applied.  

The **nr** column contains the refractive index of each sample.

The **Molecule_name** column contains the peak of fluorescence spectra as measured in the different solvents/environments. Values may be provided in eV or nm. The column name should identify the molecule.
It is also possible to include more than one **Molecule_name** column in the same file, allowing characterization or inference for multiple molecules in parallel.

Examples of input files can be found in here [here](https://github.com/LeonardoESousa/spec2epsilon/tree/main/examples)

The csv file can be uploaded to the application. Alternatively, one may use the api. A tutorial is provided [here](https://github.com/LeonardoESousa/spec2epsilon/tree/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb).
