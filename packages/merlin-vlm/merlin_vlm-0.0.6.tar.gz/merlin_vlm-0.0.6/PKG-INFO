*Merlin is a 3D VLM for computed tomography that leverages both structured electronic health records (EHR) and unstructured radiology reports for pretraining.*

## ⚡️ Installation

To install Merlin, you can simply run:

```bash
pip install merlin-vlm
```

For an editable installation, use the following commands to clone and install this repository.

```bash
conda create --name merlin python==3.10
conda activate merlin

git clone https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/Merlin.git
cd Merlin
pip install -e .

# Alternatively, to install exact package versions as tested:
# uv sync
```

## 🚀 Inference with Merlin

To create a Merlin model with both image and text embeddings enabled, use the following:

```python
from merlin import Merlin

model = Merlin()
```

To initialize the model with **only image embeddings** active, use:

```python
from merlin import Merlin

model = Merlin(ImageEmbedding=True)
```

To initialize the model for **phenotype classification**, use:

```python
from merlin import Merlin

model = Merlin(PhenotypeCls=True)
```

To initialize the model for **five-year disease prediction**, use:

```python
from merlin import Merlin

model = Merlin(FiveYearPred=True)
```

To initialize the model for **radiology report generation**, use:

```python
from merlin import Merlin

model = Merlin(RadiologyReport=True)
```

#### For inference on a demo CT scan, please check out the [general demo](documentation/demo.py) and [report generation demo](documentation/radiology_report_generation.py).

#### For additional information, please read the [inference documentation](documentation/inference.md) and [report generation documentation](documentation/report_generation.md).

## 📂  Merlin Abdominal CT Dataset

We are excited to release the **Merlin Abdominal CT Dataset** to the community!

For details on accessing and using the dataset, please see the [download documentation](documentation/download.md)!
