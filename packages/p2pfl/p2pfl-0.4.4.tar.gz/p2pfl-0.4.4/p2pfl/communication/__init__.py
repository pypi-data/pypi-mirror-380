"""
Package that contains all the logic and classes to manage the communication between the nodes.

Please check the submodules for more information. The main protocol is based on `GRPC` but there is also a local
protocol implementation for more efficient local communication.

Also decouplet utilities for the communication are implemented in the root of this package (e.g. `CommunicationProtocol`
, `Client`, `Gossiper`).
