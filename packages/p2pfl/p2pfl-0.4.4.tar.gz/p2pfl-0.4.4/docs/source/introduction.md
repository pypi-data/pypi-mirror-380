# 📘 Introduction

**P2PFL** is a general-purpose open-source library for the execution (simulated and in real environments) of Decentralized Federated Learning systems, specifically making use of P2P networks and the Gossip protocol. It empowers researchers and developers to build and experiment with federated learning models without relying on centralized servers, looking towards a more democratized and descentralized future for the ML community.

## 🤔 Why P2PFL?

Traditional federated learning often depends on a central server to orchestrate training and manage communication between participants. This approach introduces several limitations and delegates too many responsabilities to the central server. P2PFL allows nodes to communicate directly with each other, thus **reducing the dependence on an external server**.

## ✨ Key Features

P2PFL offers a range of features designed to make decentralized federated learning accessible and efficient. For detailed information, please refer to our [components](components/comp-index.md).
