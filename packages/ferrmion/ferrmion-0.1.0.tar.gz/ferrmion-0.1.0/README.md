# ferrmion

This codebase contains methods to generate qubit Hamiltonians from fermionic Hamiltonians.


## Encodings
- Ternary Tree encodings

    Any ternary tree can be generated by adding nodes to a tree structure, and functions exist to easily create standard encodings including: Jordan-Wigner, Parity, Bravyi-Kitaev and JKMN

- k-NTO encodings

    A non-ternary-tree majorana string encoding with the maximal non-trivial overlap possible.
    Only works for systems with even numbers of modes (i.e. all spin-orbit Hamiltonians)


## Optimizations

### Enumeration Scheme
- $(\lambda+\mu)$ [Evolutionary Algorithm](https://ferrmion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/pauli_weight.html#evolutionary-optimisation)
- [Simulated Annealing](https://ferrmion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/pauli_weight.html#simulated-annealing)

### Ternary Trees
- [Bonsai Algorithm](https://ferrmion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/bonsai.html)
- [Reduced Entanglement Ternary Trees](https://ferrmion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/rett.html)
- [Huffman-code Ternary Tree](https://ferrmion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/huffman.html)

## Hamiltonians
Functions to produce Hamiltonian templates and enumerated encodings are available in `ferrmion.hamiltonians`

- Molecular Hamiltonian (Born-Oppenheimer Approximation)
- Hubbard Hamiltonian (3D Square lattice)
