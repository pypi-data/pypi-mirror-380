## Overview

ZipShapeFile2DB is a Python package for extracting, filtering, and exporting ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) shapefiles into structured formats for geospatial analysis in a SQLite3 database file. 

Designed for developers and data analysts, it offers a clean command-line interface and a modular API that integrates seamlessly into Python workflows.

Whether you're automating shapefile exports, building spatial dashboards, or prepping data for SQL-based queries, ZipShapeFile2DB provides a transparent, scriptable pipeline with real-time logging, schema validation, and flexible output options.

---

## Shapefile Requirements

This module is designed to work with shapefiles derived from the 2020 ZCTA dataset
provided by the US Census Bureau.

To download the official shapefiles, visit:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-files.2020.html

This download will provid a zipped file containing all of the shapefile components (several files)

Required Shapefile Components:

    .shp (Shape Format):
        Contains the primary geometry data for each feature (points, lines, polygons).

    .shx (Shape Index Format):
        Provides an index for efficient access to geometry records in the .shp file.

    .dbf (dBASE Table Format):
        Stores attribute data linked to each geometry, such as ZIP code and classification.

Note:
    All three files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) are required for full shapefile functionality.
    The .shx file significantly improves performance when accessing large geometries.

---

## Features

- **CLI & API support** for ZCTA shapefile export  
- **Modular architecture** for easy extension and testing  
- **Google-style docstrings** for clarity and discoverability  
- **Built-in validation** for input paths and schema integrity  
- **Geospatial stack ready**: works with `geopandas`, `shapely`, and `SQLAlchemy`

---

### Installation

```bash
pip install shapefile2db
```
