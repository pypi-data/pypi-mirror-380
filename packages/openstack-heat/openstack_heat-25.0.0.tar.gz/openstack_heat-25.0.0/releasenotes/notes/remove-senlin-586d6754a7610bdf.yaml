  - |
    Integration with senlin has been removed because the senlin project has
    been retired. Because of the removal, the following resource types are no
    longer supported and now hidden.

    - ``OS::Senlin::Cluster``
    - ``OS::Senlin::Node``
    - ``OS::Senlin::Policy``
    - ``OS::Senlin::Profile``
    - ``OS::Senlin::Receiver``

    Also, the options in ``[clients_senlin]`` section have been removed.
