    There was a mismatch between the way heat create role behaved with the
    templates or with the openstack CLI on what relates to the default domain
    if the domain is not specified on both cases the CLI will not assign on
    to the created new role but the heat templates will assign the "default"
    domain
critical:

    Templates that creates roles but does not specify the domain will not get
    a "default" domain from now on. To have a domain added to your new role
    it needs to be assigned in the template.
