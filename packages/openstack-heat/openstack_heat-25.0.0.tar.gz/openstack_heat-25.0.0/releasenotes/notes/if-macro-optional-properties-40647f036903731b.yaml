    The ``wallaby`` template version introduces a new 2-argument form of the
    ``if`` function. This allows users to specify optional property values, so
    that when the condition is false Heat treats it the same as if no value
    were specified for the property at all. The behaviour of existing templates
    is unchanged, even after updating the template version to ``wallaby``.
