    The ordering in the list of segments returned by ``OS::Neutron::Net``
    resources is not predictable. Stack updates changeing attributes
    of the network can cause the list of segments to shift.

    The ordering is now slightly more predictable, segments with name=``None``
    are now placed first in the list. This doesn't guarantee the order, but
    typically only the segment implicitly created by neutron has no name
    attribute set. The template author should ensure other segments on the
    network does have a name set, so that the implicit segment will always be
    index 0. Resolving attributes of the implcitly created segment on the
    network resource can then predictibly happen using index 0. See `bug:
    1894920 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1894920>`_.
