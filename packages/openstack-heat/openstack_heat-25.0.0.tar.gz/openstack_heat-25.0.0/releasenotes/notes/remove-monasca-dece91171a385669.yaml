  - |
    Integration with monasca has been removed because the monasca project was
    retired. Because of the removal, the following resource types are no longer
    supported and now hidden.

    - ``OS::Monasca::AlarmDefinition``
    - ``OS::Monasca::Notifications``

    Also, the options in ``[clients_monasca]`` section have been removed.
