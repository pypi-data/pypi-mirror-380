Blueprints and Specs
====================

You have to create a Story in StoryBoard `heat storyboard
<https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/989>`_. And create tasks that
fit with the plan to implement this spec (A task to link to a patch in gerrit).

.. note:: heat-spacs is no longer active, there's no requirement for any
   feature to summit spac on it.

Spec from existing stories
-------------------------------

If there's an already existing story that describes feature suitable to the
story. There is no need to create a new story. The comments and history of
the existing story are important for its review.
