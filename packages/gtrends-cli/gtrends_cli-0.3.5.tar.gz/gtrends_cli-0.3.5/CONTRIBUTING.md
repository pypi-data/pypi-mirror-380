## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that establishes expectations for participation in our community. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine
3. **Create a branch** for your work
4. **Set up the development environment** (see next section)

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/google-trends-cli.git
cd google-trends-cli

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies and dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=gtrends tests/
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Implement your changes**:
   - Write code that follows the project's [coding standards](#coding-standards)
   - Include appropriate tests
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Commit your changes** using clear commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of your change"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch of the original repository
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues

6. **Address review feedback** if requested by maintainers

## Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) for function signatures
- Write docstrings in the Google style format
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Use descriptive variable names

### Code Linting and Formatting

We use:
- `black` for code formatting
- `isort` for import sorting
- `flake8` for linting

Run these tools before submitting:

```bash
# Format code
black gtrends tests

# Sort imports
isort gtrends tests

# Run linting
flake8 gtrends tests
```

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for high test coverage
- Place tests in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of the code

## Documentation

- Update the README.md if your changes affect usage
- Update or add docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods
- Consider adding examples for new features

## Issue Reporting

1. A clear, descriptive title
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Environment information (OS, Python version, package version)
6. Any relevant logs or screenshots

## Feature Requests
