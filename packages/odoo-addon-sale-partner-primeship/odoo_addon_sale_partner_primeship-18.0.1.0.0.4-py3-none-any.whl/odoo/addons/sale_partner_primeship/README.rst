This module introduces a membership concept called "primeship" for
partners.

Primeship functions as a straightforward, user-friendly membership
system that activates automatically when a sale order containing a
primeship activation product is confirmed. The membership duration is
customizable and defined in months.

The system automatically deactivates the primeship when the specified
duration expires. Users can easily verify a customer's active primeship
status and implement conditional actions based on this membership state.

Key features:

- Simple membership management for partners
- Automatic activation through sales orders
- Configurable duration in months
- Automatic expiration handling
- Easy status verification for conditional business logic

Usage
=====

To configure a product that activates primeship upon sale order
confirmation:

- Navigate to the "Sales" tab in the product form
- Enable the "Activates primeship" checkbox
- Define the primeship duration (in months)

You can easily view a customer's current primeship status directly from
their partner record:

Clicking on the primeship status widget will redirect you to a detailed
list view showing all primeship records for that specific customer:

This interface allows you to track membership history, expiration dates,
and manage customer primeship records efficiently.
