This module introduces a membership concept called "primeship" for partners.

Primeship functions as a straightforward, user-friendly membership system that activates automatically when a sale order containing a primeship activation product is confirmed. The membership duration is customizable and defined in months.

The system automatically deactivates the primeship when the specified duration expires. Users can easily verify a customer's active primeship status and implement conditional actions based on this membership state.

Key features:

  - Simple membership management for partners
  - Automatic activation through sales orders
  - Configurable duration in months
  - Automatic expiration handling
  - Easy status verification for conditional business logic
