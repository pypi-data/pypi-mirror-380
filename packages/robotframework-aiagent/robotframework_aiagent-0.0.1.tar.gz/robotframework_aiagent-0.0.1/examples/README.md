# Examples for robotframework-aiagent

This directory contains example Robot Framework tests and small helper modules that demonstrate how to use the `robotframework-aiagent` package and the included example tools.

Contents
 - `src/AIAgentExamples/WeatherTools.py` - A small example tool demonstrating how a weather tool can be implemented and used by the example tests.
 - `tests/` - Robot Framework test files that exercise the example tools and show common usage patterns.

-Prerequisites
 - Python 3.10+ (the project uses a virtual environment in the repository root).
 - Robot Framework installed in your environment. Preferably install dependencies from the repository's top-level `pyproject.toml` into a virtual environment.

Notes
 - The examples are intentionally small and meant for learning and experimentation. Adapt the tests and example tools to fit your own agent implementations.
 - If you see import errors, ensure the project package is installed into the virtual environment or update `PYTHONPATH` to include the repository root.

License
 - See the repository `LICENSE` or top-level README for license details.
