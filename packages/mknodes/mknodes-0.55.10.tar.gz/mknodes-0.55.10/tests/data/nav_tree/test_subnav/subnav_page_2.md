## Code for this page

``` py
def create_static_page(nav: mknav.MkNav):
    pass  # statically loaded page, nothing to see here
```


Finally a break to write some **regular** markdown!


## What is MkNodes

* Markdown objectified. A complete **MkDocs** project can be built by attaching nodes
  to a tree. Nodes range from atomic Markdown elements up to composed templates.

* A parametrized Webpage. Because the tree only gets evaluted when it is written,
  it can basically behave like a template. Changing the project connected to the
  tree also changes the content of Nodes which pull metadata from the project.

* **MkNodes** is aligned to the popular MkDocs/MkDocstrings/MkDocs for Material/PyMDown
  documentation stack for python. Other themes work probably, too, but are not tested.

* It is *not* a parser. The only things that get parsed are SUMMARY.md files and the
  Markdown page metadata, for the rest it´s a one-way street: Python-objects -> Markdown.

## Why MkNodes?

* Because it´s fun! Especially for people who dont like working with Markdown, this
  library enables to build great documentation webpages without writing a single line
  of markdown, and without having to deal with the actual Directory structure at all.

* Dead simple API: Basically all that is needed is initializing nodes and appending them to
  the tree (by using `+=`. All nodes are available from the `mknodes` namespace.

* Because it´s reusable. Large parts of the documentation can be written in a project-agnostic way (because the nodes are populated with metadata dynamically).

* Especially generating more complex, nested Markdown is much more comfortable.
