## Context propagation

**MkNodes** which are part of the node tree can have a context attached. If this is the case,
the context gets propagated to all children of given node.

The most common case is to have one single context for one website. That context usually contains information
about the package you want to document. It is set automatically for the root nav.

``` py
def build(project):
    root = project.get_root()
    assert root.ctx.metadata.distribution_name == "mknodes"
```

Once a node has access to the context, that context will become injected into the jinja2 namespace of given node.


``` py
@nav.route_page("My page")
def _(page):
    node = mk.MkText("{{ metadata.required_python_version }}", render_jinja=True)
    assert str(node) == ""  # not connected to any context, so returns empty string
    page += node  # Add node to the nav and allow accessing its context (assuming that nav is connected to root nav).
    assert str(node) != ""  # this now returns the required python version for the context.
```

Some nodes will also show the context metadata by default if no other data is explicitely set.

``` py
@nav.route_page("My page")
def _(page):
    node = MkLicense()
    assert str(node) == ""  # not connected to any context, so returns empty string
    page += node  # Add MkLicense to the nav and allow accessing its context (assuming that nav is connected to root nav).
    assert str(node) != ""  # this now returns the license text for the context.
```


The following graph illustrates how the context propagation works.
Any element from the tree can be attached to a context, no matter whether it is a nav, a page or any other node.
