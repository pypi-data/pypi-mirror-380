## Emoji extension index

MkNodes provides a custom emoji index for the [pymdownx.emoji](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/emoji/) extension in order to provide access to [all > 180.000 icons provided by the Iconify framework](https://icon-sets.iconify.design).

```
:[ICONSET NAME]-[ICON NAME]:
```
Example:

```
:mdi-file:
```
becomes:

:mdi-file:


!!! info
    For compatibility, icons can also be accessed from the same name as the [Material-MkDocs icon index](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/), making
    the `MkNodes` index a superset of the `MkDocs-Material` index.

    ```
    :material-file: is an alias for :mdi-file:
    ```


## Icon node

MkNodes also includes a node for Pyconify-Icons named [MkIcon][mknodes.MkIcon].
It can be used to include icons with custom color, rotation and size.
