Basically everything interesting in this library inherits from MkNode.
It`s the base class for all tree nodes we are building. The tree goes from the root nav
down to single markup elements. We can show the subclass tree by using
the MkClassDiagram Node.

## All the nodes

{{ "mknodes.MkNode" | MkClassDiagram(mode="subclasses", direction="LR", max_depth=3) }}
