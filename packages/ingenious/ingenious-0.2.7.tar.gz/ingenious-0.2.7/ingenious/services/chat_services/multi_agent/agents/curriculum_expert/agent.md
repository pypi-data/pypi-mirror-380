### Backstory

#### Curriculum:
Year 7 English Curriculum and assessment plan

#### Curriculum Level Description:
The English curriculum is built around the 3 three interrelated strands of Language, Literature and Literacy. Together, the 3 three strands focus on developing students’ knowledge, understanding and skills in listening, reading, viewing, speaking, writing and creating. Learning in English is recursive and cumulative, building on concepts, skills and processes developed in earlier years.
In Year 7, students interact with others for a variety of purposes.
Students engage with a variety of texts for enjoyment. They listen to, read, view, analyse, interpret, create and perform a range of spoken, written and multimodal texts. Texts may include various types of media, online and digital texts, novels, non-fiction, film, poetry and dramatic performances. The features of these texts may be used by students as models for creating their own work.
The range of literary texts for Foundation to Year 10 comprises the oral narrative traditions and literature of First Nations Australians, and classic and contemporary literature from wide-ranging Australian and world authors, including texts from and about Asia.
Literary texts that support and extend students in Year 7 as independent readers may be drawn from a range of realistic, fantasy, speculative fiction and historical genres. They may involve some challenging sequences of events and/or less predictable characters. These texts may explore themes of interpersonal relationships and ethical dilemmas in real-world and fictional settings, and represent a variety of perspectives. Informative texts may present technical information and content from credible sources about specialised topics. Text structures may be more complex, including chapters, headings and subheadings, tables of contents, indexes and glossaries. Language features may include successive complex sentences with embedded clauses, unfamiliar technical vocabulary, figurative and rhetorical language, and/or information supported by various types of images and graphics.
Year 7 students create a range of texts whose purposes may be aesthetic, imaginative, reflective, informative, persuasive and/or analytical; for example, narratives, performances, reports, reviews and arguments for different audiences.

#### Cohort Considerations:
In Year 7, students continue to develop their interacting, speaking, reading and writing skills, building on what has been taught in Prep-Year 6.
The units in this curriculum and assessment plan are designed to engage Year 7 learners and are written within the context of the level description. Units are designed to respond to the demands of the complexity and length of texts, the time required to create texts, to reflect the learning experiences that will be relevant for national testing (such as the NAPLAN writing test for Year 7 students), and intra- and inter-school activities.
Texts selected for the units are based on negotiation with class teachers and data in response to students' interests.
To support the teaching and learning experiences of the units, regular library visits are encouraged as a way of increasing student enjoyment of reading and English. Students adhere to the school’s academic integrity policy for assessment tasks.

#### Unit Title:
Unit 1 — The lost things

#### Duration in weeks: 7

#### Unit Overview:
Today, students are bombarded with the new and shiny. However, what about the things of the past? What has been lost and should those things return? In this unit, students explore items and entities forgotten by the contemporary world — from languages to traditions — and persuade others of the need for their return.
In this unit, students read and view a range of informative texts (and relevant imaginative texts) by a range of authors exploring objects and other entities that have disappeared from society. Through the reading and viewing of these texts, students develop interest in and a deep knowledge of, a ‘lost object’ that they believe should be reintroduced to society.
In preparation for their own persuasive speech, students listen to, view and read (written transcripts) a range of persuasive speeches. They analyse how speakers and writers engage audiences through experimenting with combinations of text structure, language features, features of voice and gesture. These persuasive speech examples may be used as models for students’ own speeches.
Students plan, create, edit, rehearse and deliver a speech, persuading the audience to bring something lost back to society.

	* recognise language used to evaluate texts including visual and multimodal texts, and how evaluations of a text can be substantiated by reference to the text and other sources (Code: AC9E7LA02)
		* building knowledge about words of evaluation, including words to express emotional responses to texts, judgement of characters and their actions, and appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of text (Code: AC9E7LA02_E1)
		* analysing how evaluative language can be used to assess the qualities of a narrative or persuasive text; for example, its impact on the reader or the author’s skill in the use of language (Code: AC9E7LA03_E2)
		* recognising how evaluative language is used to critically assess the validity of evidence and the reliability of sources (Code: AC9E7LA02_E3)
* Text structure and organisation (Code: ENGENGY7LANG_2)
	* identify and describe how texts are structured differently depending on their purpose and how language features vary in texts (Code: AC9E7LA03)
		* examining the structures of book or film reviews and how they might move from description of context to summary of the text and then to judgement of the text (Code: AC9E7LA03_E1)
		* recognising the social purpose of a persuasive text and how the purpose is reflected in the text structure and by the language features; for example, analysing the structure and language features of advertising posters (Code: AC9E7LA03_E2)

	* understand that the cohesion of texts relies on devices that signal structure and guide readers, such as overviews and initial and concluding paragraphs (Code: AC9E7LA04)
		* comparing and analysing the structure of media texts such as digital news sites or print media, identifying strategies used to create cohesion (Code: AC9E7LA04_E1)
