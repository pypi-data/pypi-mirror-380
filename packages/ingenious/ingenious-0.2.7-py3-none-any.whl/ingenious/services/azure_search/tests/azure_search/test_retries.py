"""Verify AzureSearchRetriever works with clients that have internal retries.

This module contains unit tests for the AzureSearchRetriever. Its primary purpose
is to ensure that the retriever operates correctly when the underlying Azure SDK
clients (for search or embeddings) handle transient errors like HTTP 429
(Too Many Requests) using their own internal retry mechanisms.

These tests use mock clients (`FlakySearchClient`, `FlakyEmbeddingsClient`) to
simulate this behavior without making actual network calls. This validates that our
retriever does not need its own duplicative retry logic for such scenarios.
