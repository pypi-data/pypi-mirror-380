"""
This library provides a collection of msgspec.Struct definitions for use with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Modules:
    :mod:`~evmspec.structs.block`: Contains structures related to Ethereum blocks.
    :mod:`~evmspec.structs.header`: Contains structures related to Ethereum block headers.
    :mod:`~evmspec.structs.log`: Contains structures related to Ethereum logs.
    :mod:`~evmspec.structs.receipt`: Contains structures related to Ethereum transaction receipts.
    :mod:`~evmspec.structs.trace`: Contains structures related to Ethereum transaction traces.
    :mod:`~evmspec.structs.transaction`: Contains structures related to Ethereum transactions.

Structs:
    :class:`~evmspec.ErigonBlockHeader`: Represents a block header in the Erigon client.
    :class:`~evmspec.FullTransactionReceipt`: Represents a full transaction receipt.
    :class:`~evmspec.TransactionReceipt`: Represents a transaction receipt.
    :class:`~evmspec.FilterTrace`: Represents a union of different trace types.
    :class:`~evmspec.Transaction`: Represents a generic transaction.
    :class:`~evmspec.AnyTransaction`: Represents any type of transaction.
    :class:`~evmspec.TransactionRLP`: Represents an RLP encoded transaction.
    :class:`~evmspec.TransactionLegacy`: Represents a legacy transaction.
    :class:`~evmspec.Transaction2930`: Represents a transaction with EIP-2930.
    :class:`~evmspec.Transaction1559`: Represents a transaction with EIP-1559.
