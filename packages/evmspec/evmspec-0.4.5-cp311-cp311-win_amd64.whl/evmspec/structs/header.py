    """
    Represents a block header in the Erigon client.

    This class inherits from :class:`LazyDictStruct`, which provides features for handling block header data,
    ensuring immutability and strictness to known fields. It is currently under development,
    and specific features may not yet be functional. There may be known issues needing resolution.

    See Also:
        - :class:`LazyDictStruct` for more details on the underlying structure and its features.
