"""Apache Beam utilities.

This package contains modular, reusable, and well-tested building blocks for
constructing robust Apache Beam pipelines. It is organized into subpackages
based on purpose and abstraction level.

Goals:

- Promote reuse and consistency across Beam pipelines.
- Ensure all components are easy to test and reason about.

This package is intended to scale with complex data processing needs while remaining maintainable.
