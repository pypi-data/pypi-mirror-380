"""Global Fishing Watch (GFW) namespace package.

The ``gfw`` namespace groups together related Python packages developed by
GFW. Each subpackage provides functionality for a different domain, but all
share the common namespace. This design allows multiple packages to be
distributed independently while coexisting under ``gfw``.

This distribution provides the ``gfw.common`` subpackage, which contains
shared utilities, abstractions, and helpers for data processing, validation,
and orchestration tasks across GFW pipelines.
