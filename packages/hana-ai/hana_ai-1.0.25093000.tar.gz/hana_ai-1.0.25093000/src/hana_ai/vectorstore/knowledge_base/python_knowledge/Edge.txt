The Edge class in the hana_ml.visualizers.digraph module is an entity class that represents a connection between the output port of one node and the input port of another node in a digraph framework.
------
Here is a Python code template for the `Edge` class in the `hana_ml.visualizers.digraph` module:

```python
from hana_ml.visualizers.digraph import Edge, OutPort, InPort

# Create OutPort and InPort instances
source_port = OutPort()
target_port = InPort()

# Create an Edge instance
edge = Edge(source_port=source_port, target_port=target_port)
```

Please replace the `OutPort` and `InPort` instance creation with your actual code. This is just a placeholder as the creation of `OutPort` and `InPort` instances would depend on your specific use case.
