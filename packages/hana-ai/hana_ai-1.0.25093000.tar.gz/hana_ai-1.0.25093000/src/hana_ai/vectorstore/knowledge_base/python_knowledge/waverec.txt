The waverec function in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.tsa.wavelet module is a Python wrapper for the PAL multi-level inverse discrete wavelet transform, which takes a DWT object, an optional wavelet filter, and an optional boundary padding method, and returns a DataFrame of the reconstructed time-series data from the inverse discrete wavelet transform.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided documentation:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.tsa.wavelet import DWT, waverec

# Assuming `dwt` is a `DWT` object
dwt = DWT()

# Populate `dwt` with data
# ...

# Reconstruct the original time-series data
rec = waverec(dwt=dwt)

# Print the reconstructed data
print(rec.collect())
```

Please replace the `# Populate `dwt` with data` comment with actual code to populate the `dwt` object with data. The `DWT` class is used to perform discrete wavelet transform, and its usage is not covered in the provided documentation. You may need to refer to the documentation of `DWT` for its usage.
