The DBSCAN class in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering module is a density-based data clustering algorithm that identifies clusters based on the estimated density distribution of nodes, separating high-density regions from low-density ones and allowing for the discovery of clusters of arbitrary shape in data containing noise and outliers.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering import DBSCAN

# Create a DBSCAN instance
dbscan = DBSCAN(minpts=5, eps=0.5, thread_ratio=0.2, metric='manhattan')

# Assuming that `df` is your DataFrame
dbscan.fit(data=df, key='ID')

# Print the labels
print(dbscan.labels_.collect())

# Predict clusters for new data
# Assuming that `new_data` is your new DataFrame
predictions = dbscan.predict(data=new_data, key='ID')

# Print the predictions
print(predictions.collect())
```

Please replace `'ID'` with your actual column name that represents the ID of your data points. Also, replace `df` and `new_data` with your actual DataFrame names. The `minpts` and `eps` parameters in the `DBSCAN` instance creation are just placeholders, you should replace them with the actual values that make sense for your data.
