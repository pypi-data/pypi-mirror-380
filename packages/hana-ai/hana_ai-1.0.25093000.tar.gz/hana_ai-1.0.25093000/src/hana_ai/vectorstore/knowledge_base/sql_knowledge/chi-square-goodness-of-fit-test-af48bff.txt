The chi-square goodness-of-fit test is used to determine if an observed distribution is significantly different from an expected chi-squared distribution. It calculates a chi-squared value by comparing observed and expected frequencies. This chi-squared value is then compared to a chi-squared distribution to calculate a p-value. The degrees of freedom for the test is determined by the reduction in degrees of freedom.
