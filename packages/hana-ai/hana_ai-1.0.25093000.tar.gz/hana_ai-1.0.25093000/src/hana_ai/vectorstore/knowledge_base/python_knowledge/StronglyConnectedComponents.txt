The StronglyConnectedComponents class in the hana_ml.graph.algorithms module identifies the strongly connected components of a graph, where each vertex is reachable from every other one, and provides methods to execute the calculation and return the components, their count, and the vertices.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided documentation:

```python
# Import necessary modules
import hana_ml.graph.algorithms as hga
from hana_ml.graph.hana_graph import Graph

# Assuming that 'g' is a Graph object
g = Graph()  # Replace this with actual graph initialization

# Create a StronglyConnectedComponents object
scc = hga.StronglyConnectedComponents(graph=g)

# Execute the algorithm
scc.execute()

# Print the vertices
print("Vertices", scc.vertices)

# Print the components
print("Components", scc.components)

# Print the number of components
print("Number of Components", scc.components_count)
```

Please replace `Graph()` with the actual initialization of your graph. The `execute` method runs the Strongly Connected Components algorithm on the graph. The `vertices`, `components`, and `components_count` properties provide the results of the algorithm.
