The AgglomerateHierarchicalClustering class in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering module is a widely used clustering method that groups data into a hierarchy or binary tree of subgroups, using a bottom-up strategy where each data point is initially considered as its own cluster and then iteratively merges two clusters based on a dissimilarity measure.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering import AgglomerateHierarchicalClustering

# Create an instance of the AgglomerateHierarchicalClustering class
hc = AgglomerateHierarchicalClustering(
    n_clusters=4,
    affinity='Gower',
    linkage='weighted average',
    thread_ratio=None,
    distance_dimension=3,
    normalization='no',
    category_weights=0.1
)

# Assume that df is your input data in the form of a DataFrame
# Fit the model on the given data
hc.fit(data=df, key='POINT', categorical_variable=['X3'])

# Print the combine process
print(hc.combine_process_.collect().head(3))

# Print the labels
print(hc.labels_.collect().head(3))
```

Please replace `df` with your actual DataFrame. This code assumes that your DataFrame has a column named 'POINT' that serves as the ID column, and a column named 'X3' that should be treated as a categorical variable. Adjust these values according to your actual data.
