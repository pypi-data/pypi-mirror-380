The TFIDF class in the hana_ml.text.tm module is used for term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis, providing methods to compute inverse document frequency of documents and term frequency-inverse document frequency by document.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
from hana_ml.text.tm import TFIDF

# Assuming df_train is your input dataframe
df_train = ...

# Creating a TFIDF instance
tfidf = TFIDF()

# Performing text_collector() on given dataframe
idf, _ = tfidf.text_collector(data=df_train)

# Print idf
print(idf.collect())

# Performing text_tfidf() on given dataframe
result = tfidf.text_tfidf(data=df_train)

# Print result
print(result.collect())
```

Please replace `...` with your actual dataframe.
