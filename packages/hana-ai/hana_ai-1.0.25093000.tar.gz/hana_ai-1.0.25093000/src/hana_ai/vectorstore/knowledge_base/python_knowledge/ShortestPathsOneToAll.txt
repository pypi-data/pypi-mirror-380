The ShortestPathsOneToAll class in the hana_ml.graph.algorithms.shortest_paths_one_to_all module calculates the shortest paths from a start vertex to all other vertices in a graph, with the calculation initiated by calling the execute function.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided documentation:

```python
# Import required modules
import hana_ml.graph.algorithms as hga

# Create an instance of ShortestPathsOneToAll
spoa = hga.ShortestPathsOneToAll(graph=g)

# Execute the calculation of the shortest paths one to all
spoa.execute(source=2257, direction='OUTGOING', weight='DIST_KM')

# Print the vertices and edges
print("Vertices", spoa.vertices)
print("Edges", spoa.edges)
```

Please replace `g` with your actual graph object. The `source` parameter in the `execute` method should be replaced with the vertex key from which the shortest paths one to all will start. The `direction` parameter can be 'OUTGOING', 'INCOMING', or 'ANY' which determines the algorithm results. The `weight` parameter is the variable for column name to which to apply the weight.
