The abc_analysis function in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal module is used to classify objects (like customers or products) into three categories (A, B, and C) based on their importance or value to an organization, using parameters such as data, key, revenue, and the proportions allocated to each class.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal import abc_analysis

# Perform abc_analysis
result = abc_analysis(
    data=data, 
    key='ITEM', 
    percent_A=0.7, 
    percent_B=0.2, 
    percent_C=0.1, 
    thread_ratio=0.3
)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Please replace the DataFrame `data` with your actual data. The `key` parameter should be the name of the ID column in your data. The `percent_A`, `percent_B`, and `percent_C` parameters should be the proportions allocated to A, B, and C classes respectively. The `thread_ratio` parameter specifies the ratio of total number of threads that can be used by this function.
