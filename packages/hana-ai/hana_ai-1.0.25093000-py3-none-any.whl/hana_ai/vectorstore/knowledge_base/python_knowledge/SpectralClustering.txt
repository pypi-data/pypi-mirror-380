The SpectralClustering class in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering module is a machine learning algorithm that treats data as points in space, connects them with edges, and uses the edge weights to perform low-dimension embedding of the affinity matrix between samples, followed by k-means clustering of the components of the eigenvectors in the low dimensional space.

Here is a Python code template for the SpectralClustering class:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering import SpectralClustering

# Create a SpectralClustering instance
spc = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=4,
                         n_neighbors=4,
                         init='patent',
                         distance_level='euclidean',
                         max_iter=100,
                         tol=1e-6,
                         category_weights=0.5)

# Assuming that `df` is your input DataFrame
labels = spc.fit_predict(data=df, thread_ratio=0.2)

# `labels` is a DataFrame that holds the cluster labels
print(labels.collect())
```

Please replace `df` with your actual DataFrame. The `fit_predict` method performs spectral clustering for the given dataset and returns the corresponding cluster labels. The `thread_ratio` parameter specifies the ratio of total number of threads that can be used by spectral clustering. The value range is from 0 to 1, where 0 means only using 1 thread, and 1 means using at most all the currently available threads.
