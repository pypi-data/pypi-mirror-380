The LinkPrediction class in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.linkpred module is used to calculate proximity scores between nodes in a network that are not directly linked, which can be useful for predicting missing links.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided documentation:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.linkpred import LinkPrediction
from hana_ml import DataFrame

# Assuming that a connection context to HANA has already been established
# and a DataFrame df has been created

# Create a LinkPrediction instance
lp = LinkPrediction(method='common_neighbors',
                    beta=0.005,
                    min_score=0,
                    thread_ratio=0.2)

# Calculate the proximity score of all nodes in the network with
# missing links, and check the result
res = lp.proximity_score(data=df, node1='NODE1', node2='NODE2')

# Print the result
print(res.collect())
```
