The function create_dataframe_from_shapefile in the hana_ml.dataframe module converts a shapefile into a DataFrame that is backed in SAP HANA, expecting the shapefile to be a zip and/or have both shp and dbf parts to create a single table, and returns a SAP HANA DataFrame that can be visualized.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
# Import necessary modules
from hana_ml.dataframe import ConnectionContext, create_dataframe_from_shapefile
import os

# Create a connection to the SAP HANA database instance
cc = ConnectionContext(address='<address>', port='<port>', user='<user>', password='<password>')

# Define the path to the shapefile
shapefile_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'myshape.shp')

# Create a SAP HANA DataFrame from the shapefile
hana_df = create_dataframe_from_shapefile(
    connection_context=cc,
    shp_file=shapefile_path,
    srid=4326,
    table_name="myshape_tbl"
)

# Print the DataFrame
print(hana_df.collect())
```

Please replace `<address>`, `<port>`, `<user>`, and `<password>` with your actual SAP HANA database instance details. Also, make sure that the shapefile `myshape.shp` is present in the current working directory.
