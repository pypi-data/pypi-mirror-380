The IdGenerator class in the hana_ml.visualizers.ui_components module is used to initialize itself and generate IDs, with instance variables and weak references to the object defined if necessary.
------
Here is a Python code template for the `IdGenerator` class:

```python
class IdGenerator(object):
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize self
        pass

    def id(self):
        # Method to generate id
        pass
```

Please note that this is a basic template and you may need to add your own logic to the `__init__` and `id` methods.
