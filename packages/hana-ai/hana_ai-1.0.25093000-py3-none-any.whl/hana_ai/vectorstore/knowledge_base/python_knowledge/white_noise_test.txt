The white_noise_test function in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.tsa.white_noise_test module is used to determine if a time series is a white noise series, returning 1 if it is and 0 if it isn't, and it takes parameters for data, key, endog, lag, probability, thread_ratio, and model_df.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
# Import required module
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.tsa import white_noise_test

# Assuming that 'df' is your DataFrame
print(df.head(3))

# Perform white_noise_test
stats = white_noise_test(data=df,
                         endog='SERIES',
                         model_df=1,
                         lag=3,
                         probability=0.9,
                         thread_ratio=0.2)

# Print the output
print(stats.collect())
```

Please replace 'df' with your actual DataFrame. Also, adjust the parameters of the `white_noise_test` function as per your requirements.
