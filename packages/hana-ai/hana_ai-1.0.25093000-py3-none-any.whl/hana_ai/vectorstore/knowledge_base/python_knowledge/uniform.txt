The function 'uniform' in the 'hana_ml.algorithms.pal.random' module draws samples from a uniform distribution, with parameters to specify the database connection, lower and upper bounds, number of random data to be generated, seed for the random number generator, and the proportion of available threads to use.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.random import uniform
from hana_ml import dataframe as df

# Create a connection context
cc = df.ConnectionContext(address='<address>', port='<port>', user='<user>', password='<password>')

# Draw samples from a uniform distribution
res = uniform(conn_context=cc, low=-1, high=1, num_random=10)

# Collect the results
print(res.collect())
```

Please replace `<address>`, `<port>`, `<user>`, and `<password>` with your actual database connection details.
