The function pie_plot in the module hana_ml.visualizers.eda_plotly displays a pie plot for a specified column in a SAP HANA DataFrame, with options to customize the title, font properties, figure, and subplot position.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from hana_ml.visualizers.eda_plotly import pie_plot

# Call the function
fig, pie_data = pie_plot(data, column="PCLASS", title="% of passengers in each cabin")

# Display the plot
fig.show()
```

Please replace the `data` DataFrame with your actual DataFrame. The column "PCLASS" should also exist in your DataFrame. The title is optional and can be customized as per your needs.
