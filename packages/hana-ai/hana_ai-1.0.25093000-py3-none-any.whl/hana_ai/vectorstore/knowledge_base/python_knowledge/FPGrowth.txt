The FPGrowth class in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.association module is a technique used for finding frequent patterns in a transaction dataset without generating a candidate itemset, by building a prefix tree (FP Tree) to compress information and retrieve frequent itemsets efficiently, with various parameters to adjust the algorithm's behavior.

Here is a Python code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.association import FPGrowth

# Initialize a FPGrowth object and set its parameters
fpg = FPGrowth(min_support=0.2,
               min_confidence=0.5,
               relational=False,
               min_lift=1.0,
               max_conseq=1,
               max_len=5,
               ubiquitous=1.0,
               thread_ratio=0,
               timeout=3600)

# Assume df is your input DataFrame
# Perform fit() and obtain the result
fpg.fit(data=df, lhs_restrict=[1,2,3])

# Print the result
print(fpg.result_.collect())

# Also, initialize a FPGrowth object and set its parameters with relational logic
fpgr = FPGrowth(min_support=0.2,
                min_confidence=0.5,
                relational=True,
                min_lift=1.0,
                max_conseq=1,
                max_len=5,
                ubiquitous=1.0,
                thread_ratio=0,
                timeout=3600)

# Perform fit() and obtain the result
fpgr.fit(data=df, rhs_restrict=[1, 2, 3])

# Print the result
print(fpgr.antec_.collect())
print(fpgr.conseq_.collect())
print(fpgr.stats_.collect())
```

Please replace `df` with your actual DataFrame. The `lhs_restrict` and `rhs_restrict` parameters in the `fit` method are optional and should be set according to your specific needs.
