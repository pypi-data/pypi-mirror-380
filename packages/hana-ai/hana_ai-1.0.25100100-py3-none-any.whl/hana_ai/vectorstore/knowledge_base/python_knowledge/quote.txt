The quote function in urllib.parse module in Python is used to percent-encode a URL string, preserving certain characters as specified by the 'safe' argument, with default encoding as 'utf-8' and error handling as 'strict'.
------
Here is a Python code template for the `quote` function in the `urllib.parse` module:

```python
# Import the required module
from urllib.parse import quote

# Define the string to be quoted
string = 'abc def'

# Define the safe characters
safe = '/'

# Define the encoding
encoding = 'utf-8'  # Default is 'utf-8'

# Define the error handling strategy
errors = 'strict'  # Default is 'strict'

# Quote the string
quoted_string = quote(string, safe=safe, encoding=encoding, errors=errors)

# Print the quoted string
print(quoted_string)
```

You can replace the `string`, `safe`, `encoding`, and `errors` variables with your own values. The `quote` function will return a string where all characters that are neither in the unreserved chars ("always safe") nor the additional chars set via the `safe` arg are %-escaped.
