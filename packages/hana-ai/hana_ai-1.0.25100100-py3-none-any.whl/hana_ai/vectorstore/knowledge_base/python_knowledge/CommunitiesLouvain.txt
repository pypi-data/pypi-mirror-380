The CommunitiesLouvain class in the hana_ml.graph.algorithms module is used to identify communities in a given graph, providing methods to execute the community identification, and properties to access the identified communities, their count, modularity, and vertices.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
# Import required modules
import hana_ml.graph.algorithms as hga
from hana_ml.graph.hana_graph import Graph

# Create a Graph instance
hana_graph = Graph()

# Create a CommunitiesLouvain instance
comm = hga.CommunitiesLouvain(graph=hana_graph)

# Execute the communities
comm.execute(runs=2, weight='LENGTH')

# Print the number of communities
print("Communities:", comm.communities_count)

# Print the modularity of the communities
print("Modularity:", comm.modularity)

# Print the communities histogram
print("Communities Histogram:", comm.communities)

# Print the vertices
print("Vertices:", comm.vertices)
```

Please replace `Graph()` with your actual graph instance.
