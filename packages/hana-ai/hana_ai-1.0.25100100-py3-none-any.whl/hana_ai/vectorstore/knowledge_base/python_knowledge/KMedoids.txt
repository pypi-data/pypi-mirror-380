The KMedoids class in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering module is a K-Medoids clustering algorithm that partitions observations into clusters based on their nearest cluster center, with various parameters to control the clustering process such as the number of clusters, maximum iterations, convergence threshold, thread ratio, distance level, and more.
------
Here is a Python code template for the KMedoids class:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.clustering import KMedoids

# Create a KMedoids instance
kmedoids = KMedoids(n_clusters=4, init='first_K',
                    max_iter=100, tol=1.0E-6,
                    distance_level='Euclidean',
                    thread_ratio=0.3, category_weights=0.5)

# Fit the model to the data
kmedoids.fit(data=df, key='ID')

# Print the cluster centers
print(kmedoids.cluster_centers_.collect())

# Perform fit_predict and print the result
print(kmedoids.fit_predict(data=df, key='ID').collect())
```

In this code:

- `n_clusters` is the number of clusters.
- `init` is the method for initializing the cluster centers.
- `max_iter` is the maximum number of iterations.
- `tol` is the convergence threshold.
- `distance_level` is the method for calculating the distance between data points.
- `thread_ratio` is the proportion of available threads to use.
- `category_weights` is the weight of category attributes.
- `df` is the input DataFrame.
- `key` is the name of the ID column in the DataFrame.

Please replace `df` with your actual DataFrame.
