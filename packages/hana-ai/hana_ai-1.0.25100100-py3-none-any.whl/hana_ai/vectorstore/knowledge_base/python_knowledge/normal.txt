The function 'normal' in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.random module draws samples from a normal distribution, with parameters to specify the database connection, mean, standard deviation or variance, number of random data to be generated, seed for the random number generator, and thread ratio.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.random import normal
from hana_ml import dataframe as df

# Assuming that a connection context 'cc' has been created

# Define parameters
mean = 0
sigma = 1
num_random = 10

# Draw samples from a normal distribution
res = normal(conn_context=cc, mean=mean, sigma=sigma, num_random=num_random)

# Collect and print the result
print(res.collect())
```

Please replace the 'cc' with your actual connection context and adjust the parameters as needed.
