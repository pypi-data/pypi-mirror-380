The function 'massive_fft' in the 'hana_ml.algorithms.pal.tsa.fft' module is used for massive Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) computation, with various parameters for customization such as num_type, inverse, window, window_start, window_length, alpha, beta, attenuation, flattop_model, flattop_precision, r, and flattop_mode.
------
Here is a Python code template for the `massive_fft` function from the `hana_ml.algorithms.pal.tsa.fft` module:

```python
# Import the required module
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.tsa.fft import massive_fft

# Define the data
data = None  # Replace with your data

# Define the parameters
num_type = None  # Replace with your num_type
inverse = None  # Replace with your inverse
window = None  # Replace with your window
window_start = None  # Replace with your window_start
window_length = None  # Replace with your window_length
alpha = None  # Replace with your alpha
beta = None  # Replace with your beta
attenuation = None  # Replace with your attenuation
flattop_model = None  # Replace with your flattop_model
flattop_precision = None  # Replace with your flattop_precision
r = None  # Replace with your r
flattop_mode = None  # Replace with your flattop_mode

# Call the function
massive_fft(data, num_type=num_type, inverse=inverse, window=window, window_start=window_start, window_length=window_length, alpha=alpha, beta=beta, attenuation=attenuation, flattop_model=flattop_model, flattop_precision=flattop_precision, r=r, flattop_mode=flattop_mode)
```

Please replace `None` with your actual values.
