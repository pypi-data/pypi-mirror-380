The wilcoxon function in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats module performs a one-sample or paired two-sample non-parametric test to check if the median of the data is different from a specific value, with parameters for data, column name, location mu0 for one sample test, test type, and continuity correction for p-value calculation.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
# Import required module
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats import wilcoxon

# Assuming that 'df' is your DataFrame
print(df.collect())

# Perform the wilcoxon signed rank test
res = wilcoxon(data=df, mu=40, test_type='two_sides', correction=True)

# Print the result
print(res.collect())
```

Please replace 'df' with your actual DataFrame.
