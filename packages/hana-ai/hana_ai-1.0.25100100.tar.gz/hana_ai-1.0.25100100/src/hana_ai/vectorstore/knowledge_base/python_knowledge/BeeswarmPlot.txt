The BeeswarmPlot class in the hana_ml.visualizers.shap module is used to initialize a beeswarm plot visualization for feature value and effect data.
------
Here is a Python code template for the `BeeswarmPlot` class:

```python
from hana_ml.visualizers.shap import FeatureValueAndEffect

class BeeswarmPlot(object):
    def __init__(self, feature_value_and_effect: FeatureValueAndEffect):
        """
        Initialize self.
        """
        self.feature_value_and_effect = feature_value_and_effect
        self.__dict__ = {}
        self.__weakref__ = []
```

Please note that this is a basic template and you may need to add more methods or properties based on your specific requirements. Also, the `__dict__` and `__weakref__` are Python internal attributes and you usually don't need to define them explicitly. They are included here just because they were mentioned in the help doc.
