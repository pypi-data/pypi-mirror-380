The unique function in the enum module is a class decorator that ensures all member values in an enumeration are unique.
------
Here is a basic template for using the `unique` decorator from the `enum` module in Python:

```python
from enum import Enum, unique

@unique
class MyEnum(Enum):
    VALUE1 = 1
    VALUE2 = 2
    # VALUE3 = 2  # This will raise an error because VALUE2 and VALUE3 have the same value

print(MyEnum.VALUE1)
print(MyEnum.VALUE2)
# print(MyEnum.VALUE3)
```

In this template, `MyEnum` is an enumeration with unique member values. If you uncomment the line `VALUE3 = 2`, Python will raise a `ValueError` because `VALUE2` and `VALUE3` have the same value, which violates the uniqueness constraint imposed by the `unique` decorator.
