The ShortestPath class in the hana_ml.graph.algorithms.shortest_path module is used to find the shortest path between a source and target vertex_key in a graph, with optional weight and direction, and the results can be visualized using libraries like networkX.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided documentation:

```python
import hana_ml.graph.algorithms as hga
from hana_ml.graph.hana_graph import Graph

class ShortestPath(hga.algorithm_base.AlgorithmBase):
    def __init__(self, graph: Graph):
        # Initialize self
        pass

    def execute(self, source: str, target: str, weight: str = None, direction: str = 'OUTGOING') -> 'ShortestPath':
        # Executes the calculation of the shortest path
        pass

    @property
    def edges(self):
        # Returns a Pandas DataFrame that contains the edges of the shortest path
        pass

    @property
    def vertices(self):
        # Returns a Pandas DataFrame that contains the vertices of the shortest path
        pass

    @property
    def weight(self):
        # Returns the weight of the shortest path
        pass

# Example usage
g = Graph()  # Initialize your graph here
sp = ShortestPath(graph=g).execute(source="1", target="3")
print("Vertices", sp.vertices)
print("Edges", sp.edges)
print("Weight:", sp.weight)
```

Please replace the `pass` statements with your actual implementation. Also, you need to initialize the `Graph` object `g` with your actual graph data.
