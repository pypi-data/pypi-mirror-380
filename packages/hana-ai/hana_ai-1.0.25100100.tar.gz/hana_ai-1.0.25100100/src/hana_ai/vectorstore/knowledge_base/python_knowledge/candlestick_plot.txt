The function candlestick_plot in the module hana_ml.visualizers.eda_plotly displays a candlestick plot for the SAP HANA DataFrame using specified column names for open, high, low, and closing prices, and optionally uses an existing plotly graph object.
------
Here is a Python code template for the `candlestick_plot` function:

```python
from hana_ml.visualizers.eda_plotly import candlestick_plot

# Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' with columns 'open_price', 'high_price', 'low_price', 'close_price'
open_price = 'open_price'
high_price = 'high_price'
low_price = 'low_price'
close_price = 'close_price'

# Call the function
candlestick_plot(data=df, open=open_price, high=high_price, low=low_price, close=close_price)
```

This code will create a new plotly graph object and display a candlestick plot for the given DataFrame. If you want to use an existing plotly graph object, you can pass it as the `fig` parameter:

```python
from hana_ml.visualizers.eda_plotly import candlestick_plot
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Assuming you have a DataFrame 'df' with columns 'open_price', 'high_price', 'low_price', 'close_price'
open_price = 'open_price'
high_price = 'high_price'
low_price = 'low_price'
close_price = 'close_price'

# Create a new plotly graph object
fig = go.Figure()

# Call the function
candlestick_plot(data=df, open=open_price, high=high_price, low=low_price, close=close_price, fig=fig)
```

This code will add the candlestick plot to the existing plotly graph object.
