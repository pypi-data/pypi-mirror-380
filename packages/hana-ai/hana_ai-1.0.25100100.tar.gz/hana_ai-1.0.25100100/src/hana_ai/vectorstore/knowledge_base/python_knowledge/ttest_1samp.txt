The function ttest_1samp in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats module performs a t-test on a sample of observations to determine if they could have been generated by a process with a specific mean, with parameters for the data, column name, hypothesized mean, test type, and confidence level.
------
Here is a Python code template for the `ttest_1samp` function from the `hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats` module:

```python
# Import required module
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats import ttest_1samp

# Assuming that 'df' is your DataFrame
print(df.collect())

# Perform One Sample T-Test
result = ttest_1samp(data=df, col=None, mu=0, test_type='two_sides', conf_level=0.95)

# Print the result
print(result.collect())
```

Please replace `'df'` with your actual DataFrame. If you want to specify the column for the sample, replace `None` with the column name in the `ttest_1samp` function. You can also adjust the `mu`, `test_type`, and `conf_level` parameters as per your requirements.
