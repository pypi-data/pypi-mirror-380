The f_oneway function in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats module performs a 1-way ANOVA to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of three or more independent groups, returning statistics for each group, computed results for ANOVA, and multiple comparison results.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats import f_oneway
from hana_ml import DataFrame

# Assuming that connection_context is the connection to the HANA database
df = DataFrame(connection_context, 'SELECT * FROM YOUR_TABLE')

# Perform the function
stats, anova, mult_comp = f_oneway(data=df,
                                   multcomp_method='Tukey-Kramer',
                                   significance_level=0.05)

# Print the outputs
print(stats.collect())
print(anova.collect())
print(mult_comp.collect())
```

Please replace `'SELECT * FROM YOUR_TABLE'` with your actual SQL query to fetch the data. Also, ensure that `connection_context` is the connection to your HANA database.
