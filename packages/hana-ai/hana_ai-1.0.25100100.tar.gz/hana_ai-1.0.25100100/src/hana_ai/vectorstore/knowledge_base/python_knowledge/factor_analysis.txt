The factor_analysis function in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats module is a statistical method that extracts a low number of unobserved variables, or factors, that best describe the covariance pattern of a larger set of observed variables, with various parameters to customize the analysis and returning multiple dataframes with detailed results.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided documentation:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats import factor_analysis
from hana_ml import DataFrame

# Assuming that connection_context is already defined and connected to SAP HANA
# Create DataFrame from existing HANA table
data = DataFrame(connection_context, 'MY_TABLE')

# Define parameters
key = 'ID'
factor_num = 2
col = None
method = 'principle_component'
rotation = 'varimax'
score = 'regression'
matrix = 'correlation'
kappa = 4.0

# Perform factor analysis
result = factor_analysis(data=data, key=key, factor_num=factor_num, col=col, method=method, rotation=rotation, score=score, matrix=matrix, kappa=kappa)

# Print results
for df in result:
    print(df.collect())
```

Please replace `'MY_TABLE'` with your actual table name in SAP HANA. Also, adjust the parameters as per your requirements. The `connection_context` is assumed to be already defined and connected to your SAP HANA instance.
