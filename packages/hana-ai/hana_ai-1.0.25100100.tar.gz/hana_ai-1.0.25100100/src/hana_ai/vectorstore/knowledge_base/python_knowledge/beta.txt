The function beta in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.random module draws samples from a Beta distribution, with parameters for database connection, alpha and beta values, number of random data to be generated, seed for random number generator, and thread ratio.
------
Here is a Python code template based on the provided documentation:

```python
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.random import beta
from hana_ml import dataframe as df

# Assuming that a connection context 'cc' is already created

# Set parameters
a = 0.5
b = 0.5
num_random = 100
seed = None
thread_ratio = None

# Call the beta function
res = beta(conn_context=cc, a=a, b=b, num_random=num_random, seed=seed, thread_ratio=thread_ratio)

# Collect the result
result = res.collect()

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Please replace the 'cc' with your actual connection context. The connection context is used to establish a connection to your HANA database. You may need to import additional modules based on your specific setup and requirements.
