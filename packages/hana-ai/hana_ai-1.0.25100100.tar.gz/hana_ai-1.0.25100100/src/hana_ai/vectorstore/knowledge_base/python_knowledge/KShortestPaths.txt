The KShortestPaths class in the hana_ml.graph.algorithms module is used to calculate the top-k shortest paths between a source and target vertex_key in a graph, with an optional weight parameter, and may fail for HANA versions prior to SP05.

Here is a Python code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
import hana_ml.graph.algorithms as hga
from hana_ml.graph.hana_graph import Graph

class KShortestPaths(hga.algorithm_base.AlgorithmBase):
    def __init__(self, graph: Graph):
        # Initialize self
        pass

    def execute(self, source: str, target: str, k: int, weight: str = None) -> 'KShortestPaths':
        # Executes the calculation of the top-k shortest paths
        pass

    @property
    def paths(self):
        # Returns a Pandas DataFrame that contains the paths
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def projection_expr_from_cols(source, variable, column_filter=None):
        # Turn columns into a string for projection expression
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def signature_from_cols(source, column_filter=None):
        # Turn columns into a string for script parameters
        pass

# Example usage
g = Graph()  # Initialize your graph here
topk = KShortestPaths(graph=g).execute(source="1", target="3", k=3)
print("Paths", topk.paths)
```

Please replace the `pass` statements with your actual implementation. The `Graph` object `g` should also be initialized with your actual graph data.
