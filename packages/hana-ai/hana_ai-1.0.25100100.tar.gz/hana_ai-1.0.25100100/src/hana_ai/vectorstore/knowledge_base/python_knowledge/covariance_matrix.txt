The covariance_matrix function in the hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats module computes the covariance matrix for a given DataFrame, with the option to specify certain columns, and returns a DataFrame with the covariance between any two data samples.
------
Here is the executable code template based on the provided help doc:

```python
# Import required libraries
from hana_ml.algorithms.pal.stats import covariance_matrix
from hana_ml import DataFrame

# Assuming that a connection towards HANA has been established
# conn is the connection object

# Create DataFrame
query = 'SELECT * FROM <your_table>'
df = DataFrame(conn, query)

# Compute the covariance matrix
result = covariance_matrix(data=df)

# Print the result
print(result.collect())
```

Please replace `<your_table>` with your actual table name. This code assumes that a connection towards HANA has been established and `conn` is the connection object.
