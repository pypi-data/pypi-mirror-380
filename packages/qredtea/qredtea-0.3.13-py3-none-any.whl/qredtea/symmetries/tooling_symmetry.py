    Find a representation of local symmetries as global symmetries in a TTN.

    Arguments
    ---------

    local_syms : list[tuple[...]]
        The local symmetries are passed as list of tuples, where each tuple
        contains the description of a local symmetry with the following entries.
        1) list of sites, sites are specified as a tuple of ints. 2) list of
        operators as strings corresponding to the generator of the local symmetry
        on each site. 3) str with the symmetry type as different local symmetries
        cannot be represented by one global symmetry. 4) target irreps.

    num_sites : int
        Number of sites in the system to generate a dummy-tree, where the dummy
        tree generates the paths between tensors.

    curve : :class:`HilbertCurveMap`
        Mapping for a system in n-D into 1-D.

    Returns
    -------

        blocked by local symmetries. position keys are added on top with their
        irrep.
