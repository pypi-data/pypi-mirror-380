# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release security fixes for the latest minor release of WorkflowForge. Patch updates are provided on a best-effort basis for earlier supported branches when the impact justifies the backport.

| Version | Supported              |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| 1.1.x   | ✅                     |
| 1.0.x   | ⚠️ Critical fixes only |
| < 1.0   | ❌                     |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security reports seriously. If you discover a vulnerability or suspect a security issue:

1. Email **security@brainynimbus.io** with the subject line `WorkflowForge Security Report`.
1. Provide a concise description, reproduction steps, and any potential impact.
1. Encrypt sensitive details with our PGP key if possible. The key fingerprint and download link are available on <https://brainynimbus.io/security>.

We aim to acknowledge receipt within **2 business days** and to provide status updates every **7 days** until resolution.

## Disclosure Process

- We coordinate a fix before public disclosure.
- Security advisories are posted in the GitHub Security Advisories section of the repository and referenced in the project changelog.
- Once a fix is available, we will publish patched releases and updated guidance. Please apply updates as soon as practical.

## Responsible Use

If you need to perform penetration testing or security research, use isolated environments and avoid affecting production systems. Respect rate limits on our hosted endpoints.

Thank you for keeping WorkflowForge secure!
