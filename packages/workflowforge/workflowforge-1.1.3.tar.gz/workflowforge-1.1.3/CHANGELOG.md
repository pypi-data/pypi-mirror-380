The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.3] - 2025-09-28

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflow validator recognises reusable workflows, modern job-level fields, and recently introduced trigger events to stay aligned with GitHub's schema.
