# URSA - The Universal Research and Scientific Agent

<img src="https://github.com/lanl/ursa/raw/main/logos/logo.png" alt="URSA Logo" width="200" height="200">

[![PyPI Version][pypi-version]](https://pypi.org/project/ursa-ai/)
[![PyPI Downloads][monthly-downloads]](https://pypistats.org/packages/ursa-ai)

The flexible agentic workflow for accelerating scientific tasks. 
Composes information flow between agents for planning, code writing and execution, and online research to solve complex problems.

## Installation
You can install `ursa` via `pip` or `uv`.

**pip**
```bash
pip install ursa-ai
```

**uv**
```bash
uv add ursa-ai
```

## How to use this code
Better documentation will be incoming, but for now there are examples in the examples folder that should give
a decent idea for how to set up some basic problems. They also should give some idea of how to pass results from
one agent to another. I will look to add things with multi-agent graphs, etc. in the future. 

Documentation for each URSA agent:
- [Planning Agent](docs/planning_agent.md)
- [Execution Agent](docs/execution_agent.md)
- [ArXiv Agent](docs/arxiv_agent.md)
- [Web Search Agent](docs/web_search_agent.md)
- [Hypothesizer Agent](docs/hypothesizer_agent.md)

Documentation for combining agents:
- [ArXiv -> Execution for Materials](docs/combining_arxiv_and_execution.md)
- [ArXiv -> Execution for Neutron Star Properties](docs/combining_arxiv_and_execution_neutronStar.md)

# Sandboxing
The Execution Agent is allowed to run system commands and write/run code. Being able to execute arbitrary system commands or write
and execute code has the potential to cause problems like:
- Damage code or data on the computer
- Damage the computer
- Transmit your local data

The Web Search Agent scrapes data from urls, so has the potential to attempt to pull information from questionable sources.

Some suggestions for sandboxing the agent:
- Creating a specific environment such that limits URSA's access to only what you want. Examples:
    - Creating/using a virtual machine that is sandboxed from the rest of your machine
    - Creating a new account on your machine specifically for URSA 
- Creating a network blacklist/whitelist to ensure that network commands and webscraping are contained to safe sources

You have a duty for ensuring that you use URSA responsibly.

## Development Dependencies

* [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
    * `uv` is an extremely fast python package and project manager, written in Rust.
      Follow installation instructions
      [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

* [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
    * An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.
    * After installing `uv`, you can install just ruff `uv tool install ruff`

* [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just)
    * A modern way to save and run project-specific commands
    * After installing `uv`, you can install just with `uv tool install rust-just`

## Development Team

URSA has been developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory as part of the ArtIMis project.
