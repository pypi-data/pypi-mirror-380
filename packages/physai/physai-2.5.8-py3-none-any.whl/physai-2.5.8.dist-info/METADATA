## **Overview**

**PhysAI** is a Python package for solving **ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs)** using **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**. It integrates physics directly into neural network training, allowing the solution of classic physics problems without relying on traditional numerical solvers.

PhysAI supports a wide range of physics problems including:

* **ODEs:** Logistic growth, Newton’s law of cooling, damped/simple harmonic oscillators, Markov processes.
* **PDEs:** Heat equation, wave equation, Burgers' equation, KdV equation, convection-diffusion.
* **Quantum Mechanics:** Schrödinger equation.
* **Electromagnetism & Quantum Phenomena:** Planck’s law, photoelectric effect.
* **Fluid Dynamics:** 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes.
* **Static Problems:** Laplace and Poisson equations (2D/3D).

Key features:

* Flexible **PDE/ODE residual computation** for various physics laws.
* **Mixed-precision training** for faster computation on GPUs.
* Gradient clipping and learning rate schedulers supported.
* **Visualization and animations** of solutions using matplotlib.
* Weighted loss functions combining residual and boundary conditions.

## **Quick Start Example**

```python
import torch
from physai.models import PINN
from physai.pde_residual import pde_residual
from physai.losses import pinn_loss
from physai.visualization import plot_1d_solution

# Define a 1D logistic growth ODE
def logistic(x, y):
    r, K = 1.0, 1.0
    return torch.autograd.grad(y, x, grad_outputs=torch.ones_like(y), create_graph=True)[0] - r*y*(1 - y/K)

# Create a PINN model
model = PINN(layers=[1, 20, 20, 1], activation='tanh')

# Training points
x_train = torch.linspace(0, 5, 100).reshape(-1,1)

# Train the model
from physai.trainer import Trainer
trainer = Trainer(model, collocation_points=x_train, pde_type='logistic')
history = trainer.train(epochs=500, lr=1e-3)

# Plot solution
plot_1d_solution(model, x_train, title='Logistic Growth')
```

## **Training a PDE Example: 1D Heat Equation**

```python
import torch
from physai.models import PINN
from physai.trainer import Trainer
from physai.visualization import animate_2d

# PINN model
model = PINN(layers=[2, 50, 50, 1], activation='tanh')

# Collocation points
x = torch.linspace(0, 1, 50).reshape(-1,1)
t = torch.linspace(0, 2, 50).reshape(-1,1)
inputs = torch.cartesian_prod(x.squeeze(), t.squeeze())
inputs = inputs.float()

# Trainer
trainer = Trainer(model, collocation_points=inputs, pde_type='heat')
history = trainer.train(epochs=1000, lr=1e-3)

# Animate solution
animate_2d(model, x, t, title='Heat Equation Evolution')
