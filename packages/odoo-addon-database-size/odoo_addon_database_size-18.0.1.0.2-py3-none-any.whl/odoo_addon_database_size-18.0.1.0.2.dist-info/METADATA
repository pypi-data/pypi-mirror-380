Monitor the size of your Odoo instance.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you can review the scheduled action called
'Take model size measurements' and check the time at which you want it
to run. It should only run once a day. If it runs more often, it just
updates the existing set of sizes for the day.

You may also review the Database Size settings in Odoo's general
settings and enable 'Purge Older Model Size Measurements'. This task
will by default delete most daily data older than a year except for the
data captured on the first day of each month. These retention periods
can be configured here as well.

Usage
=====

You can use this module to keep an eye on the development of the size of
your Odoo instance over time. Every day, a snapshot will be taken with
the full size of the database and the attachments. You can query these
daily snapshots, and you can compare the current size with a size at any
date of the past for which there is data.

Enable debug mode, then go to menu Settings -> Technical -> Database
Size.

The data that is gathered and that is displayed are:

- Model Name - The name of the model to which the data is related
- Estimated Rows - The number of estimated rows according to the
  Postgresql query planner. For performance reasons, taking the data
  from the planner is preferred over doing an actual count, although the
  results may be imprecise.
- Bare Table Size - The disk usage of the model table without indexes
  etc.
- Index Size - The disk usage of the indexes in the model table.
- Many2many Tables Size - The disk usage of related many2many tables,
  including their indexes. To prevent double counts, many2many tables
  are only correlated with one of their tables (the largest of the two).
- Attachment Size - The disk usage of the attachments linked to the
  model records. Because Odoo will deduplicate attachments by content,
  attachments with the same content may be counted double in the
  attachment size of other models, but will not be counted double when
  linked to records of the same model more than once.
- Total Table Size - Bare Table Size + Index Size
- Total Database Size - Total Table Size + Many2many Tables Size
- Total Model Size - Total Database Size + Attachment Size

If you click on individual records, you can inspect the sizes of each
index and many2many table.

All sizes are in megabytes.

In the 'Compare Size per Model' report view, you can find these data
twice: once for the selected measurement date (default: today), and once
for the selected comparison date (default: one month ago).

If you want to compare arbitrary dates, you can start typing the date in
the search box. Be sure to enter the dates in the right format for your
localization.
