### Evaluating against Human Designed baselines

An important part of BLADE is the final evaluation of generated algorithms against state-of-the-art human designed algorithms.
In the `iohblade.baselines` part of the package, several well known SOTA black-box optimizers are imolemented to compare against.
Including but not limited to CMA-ES and DE variants.

For the final validation **BLADE** uses [**IOHprofiler**](https://iohprofiler.github.io/), providing detailed tracking and visualization of performance metrics.


## 🎁 Installation

It is the easiest to use BLADE from the pypi package (`iohblade`).

```bash
  pip install iohblade
```
> [!Important]
> The Python version **must** be larger or equal to Python 3.11.
> You need an OpenAI/Gemini/Ollama/Claude/DeepSeek API key for using LLM models.

You can also install the package from source using <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" target="_blank">uv</a> (0.7.19).
make sure you have `uv` installed.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XAI-liacs/BLADE.git
   cd BLADE
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies via uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. *(Optional)* Install additional packages:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group kerneltuner --group dev --group docs
   ```
   This will install additional dependencies for development and building documentation.
   The (experimental) auto-kernel application is also under a separate group for now. 

## 💻 Quick Start

1. Set up an API key for your preferred provider:
   - Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), Claude, Gemini, or another LLM provider.
   - Set the API key in your environment variables:
     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
     ```

2. Running an Experiment

    To run a benchmarking experiment using BLADE:

    ```python
    import os

    from iohblade.experiment import Experiment
    from iohblade.llm import Ollama_LLM
    from iohblade.methods import LLaMEA, RandomSearch
    from iohblade.problems import BBOB_SBOX
    from iohblade.loggers import ExperimentLogger

    llm = Ollama_LLM("qwen2.5-coder:14b") #qwen2.5-coder:14b, deepseek-coder-v2:16b
    budget = 50 #short budget for testing

    RS = RandomSearch(llm, budget=budget) #Random Search baseline
    LLaMEA_method = LLaMEA(llm, budget=budget, name="LLaMEA", n_parents=4, n_offspring=12, elitism=False) #LLamEA with 4,12 strategy
    methods = [RS, LLaMEA_method]

    problems = []
    # include all SBOX_COST functions with 5 instances for training and 10 for final validation as the benchmark problem.
    training_instances = [(f, i) for f in range(1,25) for i in range(1, 6)]
    test_instances = [(f, i) for f in range(1,25) for i in range(5, 16)]
    problems.append(BBOB_SBOX(training_instances=training_instances, test_instances=test_instances, dims=[5], budget_factor=2000, name=f"SBOX_COST"))
    # Set up the experiment object with 5 independent runs per method/problem. (in this case 1 problem)
    logger = ExperimentLogger("results/SBOX")
    experiment = Experiment(methods=methods, problems=problems, runs=5, show_stdout=True, exp_logger=logger) #normal run
    experiment() #run the experiment, all data is logged in the folder results/SBOX/
    ```

### Trackio logging

To mirror results to a [Trackio](https://github.com/gradio-app/trackio) dashboard,
install the optional dependency and use ``TrackioExperimentLogger``:

```bash
uv sync --group trackio
```

```python
from iohblade.loggers import TrackioExperimentLogger

logger = TrackioExperimentLogger("my-project")
experiment = Experiment(methods=methods, problems=problems, runs=5, exp_logger=logger)
```

## 🌐 Webapp

After running experiments you can browse them using the built-in Streamlit app:

```bash
uv run iohblade-webapp
```

The app lists available experiments from the `results` directory, displays their progress, and shows convergence plots.
