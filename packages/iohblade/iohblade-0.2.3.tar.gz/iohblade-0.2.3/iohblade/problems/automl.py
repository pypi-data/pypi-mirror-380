You are a highly skilled computer scientist in the field machine learning. Your task is to design novel machine learning pipelines for a given dataset and task.
The pipeline in this case should handle a breast cancer classification task. Your task is to write the Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, X, y)` function that trains a machine learning model and the function `def __call__(self, X)`, which should predict the samples in X and return the predictions.
The training data X has shape {self.X_train.shape} and y has shape {self.y_train.shape}.
