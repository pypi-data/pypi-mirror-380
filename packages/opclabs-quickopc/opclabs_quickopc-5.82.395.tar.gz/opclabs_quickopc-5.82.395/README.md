QuickOPC
========
- NuGet package: [**OpcLabs.QuickOpc**](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpcLabs.QuickOpc)
- Python package: [**opclabs_quickopc**](https://pypi.org/project/opclabs-quickopc/)

QuickOPC is a suite of OPC Client/Subscriber development components for .NET,
COM and Python. These components are for *OPC "Classic"* (COM/DCOM-based), 
*OPC XML-DA*, and *OPC Unified Architecture* (including *OPC UA PubSub*) 
specifications.

Note: For OPC Server development, see [OPC Wizard](https://www.opclabs.com/products/opc-wizard).

QuickOPC is a commercially licensed product. Without a license key, it runs 
in a trial mode. The trial provides valid data to client or subscriber 
applications for 30 minutes; after that period, the component (your app) 
needs to be re-started, and so on. You must also comply with licensing terms 
for 3rd-party material redistributed with QuickOPC. For details, see the 
documentation.

Remember that NuGet or Python packages are primarily a tool for resolving 
build-time dependencies. The amount of functionality that you get through 
QuickOPC NuGet or Python packages is smaller than what QuickOPC can actually 
do for you. If you want a full coverage of the features, you would be better 
off downloading the Setup program from [OPC Labs Web site](https://www.opclabs.com). 
Further below you will find a list of differences between the two 
distribution forms.

QuickOPC requires **.NET Framework** 4.7.2 or **.NET** 8.0 as a minimum. Under 
.NET 8.0+, it is supported on **Linux**, **macOS** and **Microsoft Windows**. 
QuickOPC can also be easily used from **Python**.

PLEASE DO NOT USE PRE-RELEASE PACKAGES UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.

How to start
------------
If you do not mind reading the documentation: [Getting Started with QuickOPC](
https://opclabs.doc-that.com/files/onlinedocs/OPCLabs-OpcStudio/Latest/User%27s%20Guide%20and%20Reference-OPC%20Studio/webframe.html#Getting%20Started%20with%20QuickOPC.html).
Or, the whole [User's Guide](https://www.opclabs.com/resources/documentation).

Otherwise, just instantiate one of the following objects (depending on the 
OPC specification), and explore its methods:

- `OpcLabs.EasyOpc.DataAccess.EasyDAClient` (for OPC DA, OPC XML-DA Client development)
- `OpcLabs.EasyOpc.AlarmsAndEvents.EasyAEClient` (for OPC A&E Client development)
- `OpcLabs.EasyOpc.UA.EasyUAClient` (for OPC UA Client development)
- `OpcLabs.EasyOpc.UA.PubSub.EasyUASubscriber` (for OPC UA Subscriber development)

Example code
------------
C#:
```csharp
using OpcLabs.EasyOpc.UA;
...

var client = new EasyUAClient();
object value = client.ReadValue(
    "opc.tcp://opcua.demo-this.com:51210/UA/SampleServer",
    "nsu=http://test.org/UA/Data/ ;i=10853");
```

Python:
```python
import opclabs_quickopc
from OpcLabs.EasyOpc.UA import *

client = EasyUAClient()
value = IEasyUAClientExtension.ReadValue(client,
                                         UAEndpointDescriptor('opc.tcp://opcua.demo-this.com:51210/UA/SampleServer'),
                                         UANodeDescriptor('nsu=http://test.org/UA/Data/ ;i=10853'))
```
