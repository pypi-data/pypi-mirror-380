           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

``` sh

# Create a python 3.10 conda env (you could also use virtualenv)
conda create -n megatts3-env python=3.10
conda activate megatts3-env
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set the root directory
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/MegaTTS3:$PYTHONPATH"

# [Optional] Set GPU
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0

# If you encounter bugs with pydantic in inference, you should check if the versions of pydantic and gradio are matched.
# [Note] if you encounter bugs related with httpx, please check that whether your environmental variable "no_proxy" has patterns like "::"
```

**Requirements (for Windows)**
``` sh
# [The Windows version is currently under testing]
# Comment below dependence in requirements.txt:
# # WeTextProcessing==1.0.4.1

# Create a python 3.10 conda env (you could also use virtualenv)
conda create -n megatts3-env python=3.10
conda activate megatts3-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install -y -c conda-forge pynini==2.1.5
pip install WeTextProcessing==1.0.3

# [Optional] If you want GPU inference, you may need to install specific version of PyTorch for your GPU from https://pytorch.org/.
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

# [Note] if you encounter bugs related with `ffprobe` or `ffmpeg`, you can install it through `conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg`

# Set environment variable for root directory
set PYTHONPATH="C:\path\to\MegaTTS3;%PYTHONPATH%" # Windows
$env:PYTHONPATH="C:\path\to\MegaTTS3;%PYTHONPATH%" # Powershell on Windows
conda env config vars set PYTHONPATH="C:\path\to\MegaTTS3;%PYTHONPATH%" # For conda users

# [Optional] Set GPU
set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 # Windows
$env:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 # Powershell on Windows

```

**Requirements (for Docker)**
``` sh
# [The Docker version is currently under testing]
# ! You should download the pretrained checkpoint before running the following command
docker build . -t megatts3:latest

# For GPU inference
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:7929:7929 --gpus all -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 megatts3:latest
# For CPU inference
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:7929:7929  megatts3:latest

# Visit http://127.0.0.1:7860/ for gradio.
```


**Model Download**

The pretrained checkpoint can be found at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CidiSqtHgJTBDAHQ746_on_YR0boHDYB?usp=sharing) or [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/MegaTTS3). Please download them and put them to ``./checkpoints/xxx``.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For security issues, we do not upload the parameters of WaveVAE encoder to the above links. You can only use the pre-extracted latents from [link1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QhcHWcy20JfqWjgqZX1YM3I6i9u4oNlr?usp=sharing) for inference. If you want to synthesize speech for speaker A, you need "A.wav" and "A.npy" in the same directory. If you have any questions or suggestions for our model, please email us.
> 
> This project is primarily intended for academic purposes. For academic datasets requiring evaluation, you may upload them to the voice request queue in [link2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gCWL1y_2xu9nIFhUX_OW5MbcFuB7J5Cl?usp=sharing) (within 24s for each clip). After verifying that your uploaded voices are free from safety issues, we will upload their latent files to [link1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QhcHWcy20JfqWjgqZX1YM3I6i9u4oNlr?usp=sharing) as soon as possible.
> 
> In the coming days, we will also prepare and release the latent representations for some common TTS benchmarks.

## Inference

**Command-Line Usage (Standard)**
``` bash
# p_w (intelligibility weight), t_w (similarity weight). Typically, prompt with more noises requires higher p_w and t_w
python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/Chinese_prompt.wav'  --input_text "另一边的桌上,一位读书人嗤之以鼻道,'佛子三藏,神子燕小鱼是什么样的人物,李家的那个李子夜如何与他们相提并论？'" --output_dir ./gen

# As long as audio volume and pronunciation are appropriate, increasing --t_w within reasonable ranges (2.0~5.0)
# will increase the generated speech's expressiveness and similarity (especially for some emotional cases).
python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/English_prompt.wav' --input_text 'As his long promised tariff threat turned into reality this week, top human advisers began fielding a wave of calls from business leaders, particularly in the automotive sector, along with lawmakers who were sounding the alarm.' --output_dir ./gen --p_w 2.0 --t_w 3.0
```
**Command-Line Usage (for TTS with Accents)**
``` bash
# When p_w (intelligibility weight) ≈ 1.0, the generated audio closely retains the speaker’s original accent. As p_w increases, it shifts toward standard pronunciation. 
# t_w (similarity weight) is typically set 0–3 points higher than p_w for optimal results.
# Useful for accented TTS or solving the accent problems in cross-lingual TTS.
python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/English_prompt.wav' --input_text '这是一条有口音的音频。' --output_dir ./gen --p_w 1.0 --t_w 3.0

python tts/infer_cli.py --input_wav 'assets/English_prompt.wav' --input_text '这条音频的发音标准一些了吗？' --output_dir ./gen --p_w 2.5 --t_w 2.5
```

**Web UI Usage**
``` bash
# We also support cpu inference, but it may take about 30 seconds (for 10 inference steps).
python tts/gradio_api.py
```

## Submodules
> [!TIP]
> In addition to TTS, some submodules in this project may also have additional usages.
> See ``./tts/frontend_fuction.py`` and ``./tts/infer_cli.py`` for example code.

### Aligner
**Description:** a robust speech-text aligner model trained using pseudo-labels generated by a large number of MFA expert models.

**Usage**: 1) Prepare the finetuning dataset for our model; 2) Filter the large-scale speech dataset (if the aligner fails to align a certain speech clip, it is likely to be noisy); 3) Phoneme recognition; 4) Speech segmentation.

### Graphme-to-Phoneme Model
**Description:** a Qwen2.5-0.5B model finetuned for robust graphme-to-phoneme conversion.

**Usage**: Graphme-to-phoneme conversion.

### WaveVAE
**Description:** a strong waveform VAE that can compress 24 kHz speeche into 25 Hz acoustic latent and reconstruct the original wave almost losslessly.

**Usage:** 1) Acoustic latents can provide a more compact and discriminative training target for speech synthesis models compared to mel-spectrograms, accelerating convergence; 2) Used as acoustic latents for voice conversion; 3) High-quality vocoder.

This repo contains forced-align version of `Sparse Alignment Enhanced Latent Diffusion Transformer for Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis` and the WavVAE is mainly based on `Wavtokenizer: an efficient acoustic discrete codec tokenizer for audio language modeling`. Compared to the model described in paper, the repository includes additional models. These models not only enhance the stability and cloning capabilities of the algorithm but can also be independently utilized to serve a wider range of scenarios.
