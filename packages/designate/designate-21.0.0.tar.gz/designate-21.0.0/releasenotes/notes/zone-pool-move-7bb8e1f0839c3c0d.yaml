    Added zone pool move command which allows admin user to move zone from
    pool A to specified pool B. This command overcome the issues observed in
    zone export-import thereby reducing hours of time of large zone imports
    (e.g. 20-30k records). Please note, if you have moved a zone to a
    different pool, the pool must be configured with a proper tsig key for
    mini-DNS query operations. Without this, you cannot have overlapping zones
    in different pools.
