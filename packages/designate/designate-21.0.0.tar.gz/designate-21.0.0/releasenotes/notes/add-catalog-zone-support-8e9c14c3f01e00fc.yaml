    Add support for providing catalog zones.

    Designate can now optionally provide catalog zones for pools. Defined in
    `RFC 9432 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9432/>`_, catalog zones
    allow for provisioning of DNS zones on secondary nameservers through the
    sole means of DNS. A special zone, the catalog zone, serves as a list of
    all zones the secondary nameservers should serve and for which they will
    set themselves up automatically. The synchronization of zones via a catalog
    zone happens via known and proven AXFR, just like for a zone's DNS records.

    Provisioning via catalog zones is already supported by popular DNS
    implementations, such as BIND9, Knot and PowerDNS (and likely others).
    Apart from being a standardized provisioning model, the main advantage of
    catalog zones is the scalability and robustness of keeping secondary
    nameservers in sync.
