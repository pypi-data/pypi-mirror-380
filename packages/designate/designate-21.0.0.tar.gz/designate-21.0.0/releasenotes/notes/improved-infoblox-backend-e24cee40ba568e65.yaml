    The deprecated Infoblox configuration options in ``desginate.conf``
    has now been removed. All Infoblox configuration should now be in the

    In addition, the ``infoblox-client`` library is now a dependency for
    the Infoblox driver and should be installed additionally if the
    Infoblox Backend is used.
