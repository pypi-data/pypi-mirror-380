    Removed the following unused central rpc calls. This should not impact
    normal installations, but if these are used in any custom written backends
    or plugins that you are using, you will need to update your code before
    upgrading.

    - ``create_record``
    - ``update_record``
    - ``delete_record``
    - ``sync_record``
    - ``sync_zone``
    - ``sync_zones``
    - ``touch_zone``
