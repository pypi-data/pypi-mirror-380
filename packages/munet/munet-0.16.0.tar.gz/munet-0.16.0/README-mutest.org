* MUTEST

~mutest~ is a simplified testing framework designed for use by test developers
of any skill level. The test developer writes test cases, one per file, which
are made up of steps. Normally, these steps are commands to send (perhaps
repeatedly) to a target and a matching regular expression for the command output
to determine if the step passes. Variations of this common step exist for added
functionality (e.g., negative match).
