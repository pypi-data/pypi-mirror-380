Welcome to Munet (µnet)!
========================

Munet is a simple yet powerful system for creating and testing network
topologies and running programs. It makes quick and easy work of launching,
connecting and controlling namepsaces, containers (docker/podman), VMs (QEMU virtual
machines), and even connections to physical hardware. In other words, basically
anything one might want to use!

Munet's name (i.e., μnet) was derived from earlier work in FRR called "micronet". :)
