Usage
=====


To use this module, you need to:

* Go to a sale order.
* Click on "Pay Sale Advance".
* Select the Journal and specify the amount of the advanced payment.
* "Make Advance Payment".

When generating the invoice, the system displays the advanced payments, select those you want to add to the invoice.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Split several computed values in separate fields (mls, advance_amount, amount_residual).
This allows a better comprehension of logic, and a better inheritance possibility.
