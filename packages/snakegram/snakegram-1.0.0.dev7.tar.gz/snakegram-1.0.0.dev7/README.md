    'session',
    api_id=1234567,
    api_hash='0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'
)

# Handle incoming "ping" messages
@client.on_update(
    filters.new_message
    & ~ (
        filters.proxy.message.out
        |
        (filters.proxy.message % types.MessageService)
    )
    & filters.proxy.message.message.lower() == 'ping'
)
async def ping_handler(update):
    await client.send_message(update.message.peer_id, '*PONG*')
