Snakegram is a Python library for interacting with Telegram. It provides a simple, flexible interface to create bots, clients, and automated workflows with Python.

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/mivmi/snakegram.git@dev
```

**Install the last PyPI release (may not include recent changes):**

## Quick Start Example

client = Telegram(
    'session',
    api_id=1234567,
    api_hash='0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef'
)

# Handle incoming "ping" messages
@client.on_update(
    filters.new_message
    & ~ (
        filters.proxy.message.out
        |
        (filters.proxy.message % types.MessageService)
    )
    & filters.proxy.message.message.lower() == 'ping'
)
async def ping_handler(update):
    await client.send_message(update.message.peer_id, '*PONG*')
