Wrapper for handling HTTP requests to Zafia and Mafia APIs.

This module defines the `HttpWrapper` class, which simplifies authenticated
requests to Zafia and Mafia services. It delegates low-level operations to
the `Http` client while managing headers, and API
endpoints.

Typical usage example:
    http = HttpWrapper()
    response = await http.zafia_request(
        method="get",
        endpoint=ZafiaEndpoints.USER_PROFILE,
        params={"uid": "123456"},
        user_id="123456"
    )

        Builds the full request URL and headers using `build_zafia_headers`, then
