Data models used across the Mafia Online game.

This module defines the core structured data types used for player profiles,
rooms, server configuration, chat messages, GUI settings, and more. These
models are built using `msgspec.Struct` for efficient (de)serialization
of network packets and are tied to backend field renaming constants.

Typical usage example:

    from zafiaonline.structures.models import ModelUser, ModelRoom

    user = ModelUser(username="Player123", password="21242424")
    room = ModelRoom(room_id="ru_96180a0e-57bd-4f4f-bf72-3e0978351761", max_players=12)
