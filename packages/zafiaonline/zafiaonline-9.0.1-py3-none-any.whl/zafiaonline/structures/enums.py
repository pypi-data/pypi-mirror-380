Enumerations for the Mafia game server.

This module defines various enums used throughout the Mafia game backend.
These enums represent things like player roles, user settings, game events,
chat message types, and rating systems.

Typical usage example:

    from mafia.enums import Roles, RatingMode

    if user.role == Roles.SHERIFF:
        investigate(user)

    if leaderboard.mode == RatingMode.TODAY:
        print(f"Today's rating is {leaderboard}")
