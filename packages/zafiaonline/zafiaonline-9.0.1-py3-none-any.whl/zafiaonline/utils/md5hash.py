Utilities for MD5 hashing.

This module provides a static utility class `Md5` that includes methods
for computing MD5 hashes, with and without repeated salting.

Typical usage involves hashing sensitive strings such as passwords or tokens
in a way compatible with the Mafia protocol (which requires a specific salt
and number of iterations).
