Utility decorators for user validation and message handling in MafiaOnline.

This module contains decorators used to simplify validation logic when handling
user messages and checking room participation in the MafiaOnline API client.

Typical usage example:
    @extract_message
    async def handle_text(self, content: str):
        print(f"User said: {content}")

    @room_participation_required
    async def send_to_room(self, room_id: str):
        pass

    A collection of static decorator methods for API request handling and validation.

    This class provides reusable decorators to be applied to asynchronous methods in

    player ID resolution, room validation, and packet message extraction. They help
    enforce consistency and reduce boilerplate across API interactions.
