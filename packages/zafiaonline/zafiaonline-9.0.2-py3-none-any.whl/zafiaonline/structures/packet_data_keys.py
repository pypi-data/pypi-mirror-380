Enums and renaming dictionaries for networking and API communication.

This module contains enum classes and key renaming mappings used for encoding
and decoding messages between clients and servers in Mafia Online and Zafia Online.

Typical usage example:

    from mafia.enums_and_keys import PacketDataKeys, Renaming

    value = PacketDataKeys.USERNAME
    renamed_dict = rename_payload(data, rename_map=Renaming.USER)
"""

    This class defines short string identifiers used in network packets

    payload size and improve communication efficiency.

    Each enum member maps a semantic constant name to a short code, often
    a single letter or abbreviation, which identifies a specific action,
    status, user attribute, or system message in the protocol.
