Custom exception classes for Mafia Online client.

This module defines application-specific exceptions used throughout the
Mafia Online WebSocket client codebase. These exceptions allow for precise
handling of login failures, bans, and other client-side error conditions.

Typical usage example:

    from zafiaonline.exceptions import LoginError, BanError

    if not user_logged_in:
        raise LoginError("Invalid credentials")

    if server_response["type"] == "USER_BLOCKED":
        raise BanError(client, server_response, auth)
"""
from zafiaonline.main import Client
from zafiaonline.structures.packet_data_keys import PacketDataKeys


class ListenDataException(Exception):
    """
    Raised when an error occurs while receiving data from the WebSocket
    listener.

    This exception is typically used to indicate unexpected issues during the
    WebSocket message listening process, such as malformed data, timeouts, or
    disconnections that were not handled properly.

    Exception raised when a user is banned by the server.

    Attributes:
        client (Client): The client instance associated with the banned user.
