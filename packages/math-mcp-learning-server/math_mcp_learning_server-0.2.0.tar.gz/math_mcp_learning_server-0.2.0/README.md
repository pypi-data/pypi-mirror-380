# Math MCP Learning Server

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/math-mcp-learning-server.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/math-mcp-learning-server/)

A **persistent quantitative workspace** built as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This project transforms from a basic calculator to provide **cross-session state persistence** - a unique capability that Claude Sonnet 4 cannot achieve natively.

Perfect for learning MCP fundamentals, demonstrating enterprise-grade patterns, and serving as a foundation for advanced mathematical workflows.

## Features

### üöÄ Persistent Workspace (New!)
- **Cross-Session State**: Save calculations and access them across different Claude sessions
- **Persistent Storage**: Variables survive server restarts and session changes
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows (`%LOCALAPPDATA%`), macOS, and Linux (`~/.math-mcp`)
- **Thread-Safe**: Concurrent access with atomic file operations

### üßÆ Mathematical Operations
- **Safe Expression Evaluation**: Securely evaluate mathematical expressions with enhanced error handling
- **Educational Annotations**: Responses include difficulty levels and learning metadata
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance
- **Financial Calculations**: Compound interest calculations with formatted output
- **Unit Conversions**: Length, weight, and temperature conversions

### üîí Enterprise-Grade Quality
- **Security Logging**: Monitor and log potentially dangerous expression attempts
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic validation for inputs and structured content responses
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Complete test coverage with security and edge case validation
- **Zero Dependencies**: Core persistence features use only Python stdlib

## Built with MCP Python SDK

This server is built using the official [Model Context Protocol Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) with FastMCP patterns for rapid development and clean code architecture.

## Available Tools

### üóÑÔ∏è Persistent Workspace Tools

#### `save_calculation`
Save calculations to persistent storage for access across sessions.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "portfolio_return",
  "expression": "10000 * 1.07^5",
  "result": 14025.52
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Save complex financial calculations
- Store frequently used values
- Build persistent calculation workflows

#### `load_variable`
Access previously saved calculations from any Claude session.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "portfolio_return"
}
```
Returns the saved calculation with its expression, result, and metadata.

### üìä Mathematical Tools

#### `calculate`
Safely evaluate mathematical expressions with support for basic operations and math functions.

**Examples:**
```
2 + 3 * 4          ‚Üí 14
sqrt(16)          ‚Üí 4.0
sin(3.14159/2)    ‚Üí 1.0
abs(-5)           ‚Üí 5.0
```

#### `statistics`
Perform statistical calculations on lists of numbers.

**Operations:** `mean`, `median`, `mode`, `std_dev`, `variance`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "operation": "mean"
}
```

#### `compound_interest`
Calculate compound interest for investments.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "principal": 1000,
  "rate": 0.05,
  "time": 5,
  "compounds_per_year": 12
}
```

#### `convert_units`
Convert between different units of measurement.

**Supported unit types:**
- **Length**: mm, cm, m, km, in, ft, yd, mi
- **Weight**: g, kg, oz, lb
- **Temperature**: c, f, k (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)

## Available Resources

### `math://workspace`
View your complete persistent workspace with all saved calculations, metadata, and statistics.

**Returns:**
- All saved variables with expressions and results
- Educational metadata (difficulty, topic)
- Workspace statistics (total calculations, session count)
- Timestamps for tracking calculation history

**Example Output:**
```markdown
# Math Workspace (2 variables)

## Saved Variables
- **portfolio_return**: `10000 * 1.07^5` = 14025.52
  - Metadata: difficulty: intermediate, topic: finance
- **circle_area**: `pi * 5^2` = 78.54
  - Metadata: difficulty: basic, topic: geometry

## Statistics
- Total Calculations: 2

## Installation

### Quick Install from PyPI

The easiest way to use this MCP server is to install it directly from PyPI:

```bash
# Install and run using uvx (recommended)
uvx math-mcp-learning-server

# Or install globally
uv tool install math-mcp-learning-server
```

### Development Setup

For development or to run tests:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/huguesclouatre/math-mcp-learning-server.git
cd math-mcp-learning-server

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Start the MCP server
uv run math-mcp-learning-server
```

### Adding New Tools

1. Define input/output models with Pydantic
2. Add `@mcp.tool()` decorated function
3. Implement tool logic with proper validation
4. Add corresponding tests

### Security Considerations

The `calculate` tool uses restricted `eval()` with:
- Whitelist of allowed characters and functions
- Restricted global scope (only `math` module and `abs`)
- No access to dangerous built-ins or imports

## Usage with Claude Code and Claude Desktop

### Claude Code (Recommended)

Add the MCP server using the Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add mathmcp uvx math-mcp-learning-server
```

This automatically configures the server to run from PyPI using uvx.

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "math": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["math-mcp-learning-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Development Configuration

For development with local code:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "math": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "math-mcp-learning-server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/math-mcp-learning-server"
    }
  }
}
```
