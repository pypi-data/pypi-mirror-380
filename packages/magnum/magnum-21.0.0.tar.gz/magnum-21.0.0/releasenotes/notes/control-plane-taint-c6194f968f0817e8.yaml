    Adds initial support for Kubernetes v1.28
upgrade:
  - |
    The taint for control plane nodes have been updated from
    'node-role.kubernetes.io/master' to
    'node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane', in line with upstream. Starting
    from v1.28, the old taint no longer passes conformance.
    New clusters from existing cluster templates will have this change.
    Existing clusters are not affected.
    This will be a breaking change for Kubernetes <v1.20, which is EOL and not
    supported in this version of Magnum.
