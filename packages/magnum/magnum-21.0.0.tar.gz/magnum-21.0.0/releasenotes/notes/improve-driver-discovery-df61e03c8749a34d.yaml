    Add a feature to prevent drivers clashing when multiple drivers are able to
    provide the same functionality.

    Drivers used to be selected based on a tuple of (server_type, os, coe). This
    can be a problem if multiple drivers provides the same functionality, e.g. a
    tuple like (vm, ubuntu, kubernetes).

    To allow for this, it is now possible to explicitly specify a driver name,
    instead of relying on the lookup. The driver name is the same as the
    entrypoint name, and can be specified by a Cluster Template through the
    Glance image property "magnum_driver".
