    Deprecate the use of os_distro 'coreos' with COE 'kubernetes'.
    CoreOS (not Fedora CoreOS) has been EOL since 2020-05-26.  Users using COE
    'kubernetes' are encouraged to migrate to Fedora CoreOS and the
    'fedora-coreos' driver. 'coreos' driver will be removed in a future
    Magnum verison.
