    Remove support for cluster upgrades with the Heat driver.
    The Heat driver can longer support cluster upgrades due to these being
    unreliable and untested. The action now returns an HTTP 500 error.
    A Cluster API driver provides a way forward for Magnum to support this
    api action again for Kubernetes.
    In the meantime blue/green deployments, where a replacement cluster is
    created, remain a viable alternative to cluster upgrades.
