    `docker.io/k8scloudprovider` to `registry.k8s.io/provider-os/`.

    Magnum Core Team has historically limit changing of defaults in labels.
    This is because existing Cluster Templates in a deployment falls back to
    using the defaults in code if a specific label is not specified. If
    defaults change, an existing deployment's Cluster Templates may stop
    working after a Magnum upgrade.

    Magnum will now no longer keep image tag labels (e.g. cloud_provider_tag,
    flannel_tag) static. Please specify explicitly all image tags for the
    images your Cluster Templates will be using, to prevent a future change
    breaking your Cluster Templates. Refer to the documentation under
    'Supported Labels' for a list of labels Magnum is tested with.
