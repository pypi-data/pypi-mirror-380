    We have corrected the authentication scope in Magnum drivers when
    authenticating to create certs, so that trusts can work properly. This will
    change the authenticated user from trustee to trustor (as trusts designed
    for). This change affects all drivers that inherit from common Magnum
    drivers (Heat drivers).
    If you have custom policies that checks for trustee user, you will need to
    update them to trustor.
