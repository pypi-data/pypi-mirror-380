    Support `hyperkube_prefix` label which defaults to k8s.gcr.io/. Users now
    have the option to define alternative hyperkube image source since the
    default source has discontinued publication of hyperkube images for
    `kube_tag` greater than 1.18.x. Note that if `container_infra_prefix` label
    is define, it still takes precedence over this label.
