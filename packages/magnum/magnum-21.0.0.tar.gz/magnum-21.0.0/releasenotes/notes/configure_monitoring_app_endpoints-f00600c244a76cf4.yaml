features:

    Added monitoring_ingress_enabled magnum label to set up ingress with
    path based routing for all the configured services
    {alertmanager,grafana,prometheus}. When using this,
    cluster_root_domain_name magnum label must be used to setup base path
    where this services are available.
    Added cluster_basic_auth_secret magnum label to configure basic auth
    on unprotected services {alertmanager and  prometheus}. This is only
    in effect when app access is routed by ingress.
upgrade:

    Configured {alertmanager,grafana,prometheus} services logFormat to
    json to enable easier machine log parsing.
