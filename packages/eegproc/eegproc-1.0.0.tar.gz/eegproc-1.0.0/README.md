# EEGProc: EEG Preprocessing and Featurization Library

EEGProc is a fully vectorized library designed for preprocessing and extracting features from EEG (Electroencephalogram) data. This library is optimized for performance and ease of use, making it suitable for researchers and developers working in the field of neuroscience, biomedical engineering, and machine learning.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Includes functions for filtering, artifact removal, and normalization of EEG signals.
- **Featurization**: Extracts meaningful features from EEG data, such as power spectral density, band power, and more.
- **Vectorized Operations**: Fully vectorized implementation ensures high performance and scalability for working with pandas dataframes.
- **Ease of Integration**: Designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Python workflows.

## Installation

To install EEGProc, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install eegproc
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies manually:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VitorInserra/EEGProc.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd EEGProc

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Preprocessing EEG Data

```python
import pandas as pd
from eegproc import bandpass_filter

# Example: Preprocess raw EEG data
data: pd.DataFrame = ...  # Load your raw EEG data as a dataframe
bandpass_filtered_data: pd.DataFrame = bandpass_filter(data)
```

### Extracting Features

```python
from eegproc import psd

# Example: get Power Spectral Density from a bandpass filtered dataframe
psd_data: pd.DataFrame = psd(bandpass_filitered_data)
```

## File Structure
