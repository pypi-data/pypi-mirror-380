`jvserve` is a FastAPI-based web server designed for loading and interacting with JIVAS agents. It is built on top of [`jac-cloud`](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci/tree/main/jac-cloud) and provides a robust platform for managing jivas agent jobs, handling webhooks, and executing actions within the JIVAS ecosystem.

## Installation

To install `jvserve`, use `pip`:

```sh
pip install jvserve
```

## Usage

To use `jvserve`, you can start the server with the following command:

```sh
jac jvserve <path_to_your_jac_file>
```

For example:

```sh
jac jvserve main.jac
```

You can also start a file server to serve static files:

```sh
jac jvfileserve <directory>
```

For example:

```sh
jac jvfileserve ./static
```

- **port**: Port number to bind the server (default: `8000`).
- **loglevel**: Logging level (default: `INFO`).

```
