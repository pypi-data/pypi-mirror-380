    This consolidates all read-only operations into a single tool following MCP best practices.

    IMPORTANT: Server URL Configuration
    ----------------------------------
    This tool requires a server URL to connect to your Jupyter server. You have two options:

    Option 1 - Call setup_notebook first (RECOMMENDED):
        setup_notebook("my_notebook", server_url="http://localhost:9999")
        query_notebook("my_notebook", "view_source")  # Uses stored URL automatically

    Option 2 - Pass server_url explicitly every time:
        query_notebook("my_notebook", "view_source", server_url="http://localhost:9999")

    If neither is done, it defaults to http://localhost:8888 which may not be correct.

    Args:
        notebook_path: Path to the notebook file (.ipynb extension will be added if missing),
                       relative to the Jupyter server root.
        query_type: Type of query to perform. Options:
            - 'view_source': View source code of notebook (single cell or all cells)
            - 'check_server': Check if Jupyter server is running and accessible
            - 'list_sessions': List all notebook sessions on the server
            - 'get_position_index': Get the index of a code cell
        execution_count: (For view_source/get_position_index) The execution count to look for.
            IMPORTANT: This is the number shown in square brackets like [3] in Jupyter UI.
            Only available for executed code cells. Must be an integer (e.g., 3).
            COMMON MISTAKE: Don't confuse with position_index!
            - execution_count=3 finds the cell that was executed 3rd (shows [3] in Jupyter)
            - position_index=3 finds the 4th cell in the notebook (0-indexed position)
        position_index: (For view_source) The position index to look for.
            This is the cell's physical position in the notebook (0-indexed).
            Examples: first cell = 0, second cell = 1, third cell = 2, etc.
            Works for all cell types (code, markdown, raw). Must be an integer.
        cell_id: (For get_position_index) Cell ID like "205658d6-093c-4722-854c-90b149f254ad".
            This is a unique identifier for each cell, visible in notebook metadata.
        server_url: Server URL to connect to. If not provided, uses the URL stored by setup_notebook,
                   or falls back to http://localhost:8888

    Returns
    -------

            - list_sessions: list of notebook sessions
            - get_position_index: int positional index

    Note that users can edit cell contents too, so if you assume you know the position_index
    of the cell to execute based on past chat history, you should first make sure the notebook state
    matches your expected state using your query_notebook tool. If it does not match the
    expected state, you should then use your query_notebook tool to update your knowledge of the

    Will create a new empty Jupyter notebook if needed on the server.

    **CALL THIS FIRST** - This tool must be called before using other notebook tools
    to establish the server URL connection. All subsequent notebook operations will
    use the server URL stored by this tool.

    This tool creates an empty notebook. To add content, use the modify_notebook_cells
    tool after creation:

    Example usage:
        # Step 1: REQUIRED - Setup notebook with correct server URL
        setup_notebook("demo", server_url="http://localhost:9999")

        # Step 2: Add cells (these now use the stored server URL automatically)
        modify_notebook_cells("demo", "add_markdown", "# Title\\n\\nDescription")
        modify_notebook_cells("demo", "add_code", "print('Hello World')")

    This tool assumes a Jupyter server is already running and accessible at the specified
    `server_url`. It connects to this existing server to manage the notebook.

    Note that notebook_path must be relative to the Jupyter server root, not an absolute
    filesystem path.

    Args:
        notebook_path: Path to the notebook, relative to the Jupyter server root.
        server_url: Jupyter server URL (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to specify explicitly).
                    This URL will be stored and used for subsequent interactions with this notebook.
                    If not provided, defaults to http://localhost:8888 which may not be correct for your setup.
                    Common values: http://localhost:8888, http://localhost:9999, etc.
