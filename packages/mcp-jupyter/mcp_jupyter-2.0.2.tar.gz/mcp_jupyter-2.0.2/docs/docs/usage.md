# Usage

Learn how to use MCP Jupyter effectively with your AI assistant.

## Basic Usage

### Creating a New Notebook

Ask your AI assistant to create a notebook:

```
"Create a new notebook called data_analysis.ipynb"
```

The AI will:
1. Create the notebook file
2. Start a kernel
3. Be ready for your commands

### Working with Existing Notebooks

```
"Open the notebook experiments/model_training.ipynb"
```

Your AI assistant will connect to the existing notebook and preserve all current state.

## Key Features

### State Preservation
All variables, data, and models remain available throughout your session. Work with large datasets without reloading, and hand off complex objects between you and the AI.

### Automatic Error Recovery
The AI sees execution errors in real-time and can automatically install missing packages, fix syntax issues, or suggest corrections.

### Seamless Collaboration  
Switch between manual exploration and AI assistance at any point. The AI builds on your work, and you can take over whenever needed.

### Smart Package Management
Missing dependencies are automatically detected and installed, so your workflow isn't interrupted by import errors.

## Common Use Cases

MCP Jupyter excels at collaborative data work. Here are popular use cases:

### Data Analysis & Exploration
- **Data cleaning & profiling**: "Handle missing values, outliers, and analyze data quality"
- **Exploratory analysis**: "Show me key patterns, distributions, and statistical summaries"
- **Trend analysis**: "Plot time series trends with seasonality and correlations"

### Machine Learning & Modeling
- **End-to-end ML pipeline**: "Prepare data, engineer features, and compare multiple algorithms"
- **Model optimization**: "Tune hyperparameters and evaluate performance comprehensively"
- **Experiment analysis**: "Analyze A/B tests and statistical significance"

### Data Visualization & Reporting
- **Automated visualization**: "Create appropriate charts and statistical plots for this data"
- **Custom dashboards**: "Build interactive visualizations and reports"
- **Anomaly detection**: "Identify and visualize unusual patterns"

### Research & Advanced Analysis
- **Hypothesis testing**: "Test statistical differences and relationships between variables"
- **Cohort & behavioral analysis**: "Track user patterns and segment analysis over time"
- **Concept exploration**: "Demonstrate and compare different analytical methods"

### Workflow Automation
- **Data pipelines**: "Create repeatable ETL processes and data validation workflows"
- **Report automation**: "Generate recurring analysis reports with charts and summaries"
- **Code assistance**: "Debug analysis code and explain complex statistical concepts"

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Instructions

Be specific about what you want:
- ❌ "Analyze the data"
- ✅ "Perform exploratory data analysis focusing on customer segments and seasonal patterns"

### 2. Specify Cell Types Clearly

Help the AI choose the right cell type and operation:
- **For code**: "Add a code cell that loads the data"  
- **For markdown**: "Create a markdown cell with the project title and description"
- **For mixed content**: "Add a markdown cell explaining the analysis, then add code to implement it"

### 3. Handle Operation Errors

Common AI mistakes and corrections:
- ❌ AI says "edit_markdown" → ✅ Should be `operation="add_markdown"` or `operation="edit_markdown"`
- ❌ Putting ASCII art in code cells → ✅ "Put that ASCII art in a markdown cell instead"
- ❌ IndentationError on non-code content → ✅ "That content belongs in markdown, not code"

### 4. Iterative Refinement

Work iteratively with the AI:
```
1. "Load and preview the customer data"
2. Review the output
3. "Focus on customers from the last quarter" 
4. "Now segment them by purchase frequency"
```

### 5. State Management

- Keep important variables in the global namespace
- Use descriptive variable names  
- Periodically check available variables with `dir()` or `locals()`

### 6. Error Recovery

When errors occur:
- Let the AI see and handle the error
- Clarify cell type if there's confusion: "That should be markdown, not code"
- Provide context if needed
- The AI will install packages or fix issues automatically

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Use Markdown cells**: Ask the AI to document its analysis
2. **Save checkpoints**: Periodically save important state
3. **Combine approaches**: Use AI for boilerplate, manually tune details
4. **Leverage errors**: Let errors guide package installation
5. **Incremental development**: Build complex analyses step by step
