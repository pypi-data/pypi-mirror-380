Full changelog [here](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/compare/v0.4.6...v0.4.7).


## [0.4.6] - 2025-04-16
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ucc/0.4.6/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/releases/tag/v0.4.6)

In version 0.4.6, we refactored the UCC benchmarking workflows and migrated them to a
standalone repository [ucc-bench](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc-bench). We updated the corresponding [documention](https://ucc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarking.html), adding details on the benchmarked circuits and compiler configurations. As part of this migration, benchmarks can be run on pending PRs to understand the performance implications of a change before merging. The results are posted as comments to the PR (see [here](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/pull/359#issuecomment-2876701484) for an example). Going forward, changes related to benchmarking infrastructure will be primarily tracked in the [ucc-bench](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc-bench) repository.

In preparation for supporting compilation of dynamic circuits, we removed a previously default target gateset compiler pass, and instead added support for users to specify a target gateset to apply post-compilation.

We also started work on a fault tolerance checker based on [this](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/discussions/344) discussion. We are developing the prototype in a separate [ucc-ft](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc-ft), and will track progress there until we reach a point to consider merging the functionality back into ucc.

We also migrated to [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management, and enable Dependabot for upgrading dependencies.

## [0.4.5] - 2025-04-15
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ucc/0.4.5/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/releases/tag/v0.4.5)

In version 0.4.5, we enabled plotting of relative errors on the simulated benchmarks and continued refinement of the expectation value benchmarking flow,
including the addition of a custom observable for QCNN circuits and adjustments in the applied gate error rates to reflect capabilities of current devices.

We also automated the pypi publishing workflow upon release, added support for Qiskit 2.0 along with other dependency upgrades,
and updated our infrastructure to reflect the GitHub rebranding of UCC's home organization, [Unitary Foundation](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation)

Thanks to our first external contributor @Shivansh20128 for improving UCC code and documentation!
