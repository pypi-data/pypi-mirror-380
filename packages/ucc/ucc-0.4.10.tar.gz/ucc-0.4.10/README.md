The **Unitary Compiler Collection (UCC)** is a Python library for frontend-agnostic, high performance compilation of quantum circuits. UCC's goal is to gather together the best of open source compilation to make quantum programming simpler, faster, and more scalable.

By leveraging [qBraid](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid), UCC interfaces automatically with multiple quantum computing frameworks, including [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq), and [PyTKET](https://github.com/CQCL/tket) and supports programs in OpenQASM 2 and [OpenQASM 3](https://openqasm.com/). For the full list, just call `ucc.supported_circuit_formats`.

## Quickstart

### Installation

**Note**: UCC requires Python version â‰¥ 3.12.

For normal users of `UCC`, you can install via `pip` as
```bash
pip install ucc
```

If developing, including if building custom transpiler passes, please install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), which is used to managed dependencies and ensure a reproducible development enviroment. Once uv is installed, setup your development environment via

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc.git
cd ucc
uv sync --all-extras --all-groups
```

This `uv sync` command ensures the optional developer and documentation dependences are installed. For development with uv, we assume you either prefix each command with ``uv run``, or
you first activate the [uv managed virtual environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/#using-a-virtual-environment) by running ``source .venv/bin/activate`` in your shell.

For more details on using uv, refer to its [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-uv/).


### Example with Qiskit, Cirq, and PyTKET

Define a circuit with your preferred quantum SDK and compile it!

```python
from ucc import compile

from pytket import Circuit as TketCircuit
from cirq import Circuit as CirqCircuit
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit as QiskitCircuit
from cirq import H, CNOT, LineQubit

def test_tket_compile():
    circuit = TketCircuit(2)
    circuit.H(0)
    circuit.CX(0, 1)
    compile(circuit)

def test_qiskit_compile():
    circuit = QiskitCircuit(2)
    circuit.h(0)
    circuit.cx(0, 1)
    compile(circuit)

def test_cirq_compile():
    qubits = LineQubit.range(2)
    circuit = CirqCircuit(
        H(qubits[0]),
        CNOT(qubits[0], qubits[1]))
    compile(circuit)
```

## How does UCC stack up?

UCC seeks to provide an end-to-end compiler that works well for the majority of the users out of the box. Today, this is achieved by running a particular subset of [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit) transpiler passes.
To ensure we continue to improve performance and meet user needs, we regularly run benchmarks comparing UCC against the latest versions of leading quantum compiler frameworks across a range of circuits. Hereâ€™s the latest:
![alt text](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc-bench/blob/main/results/ucc-benchmarks-8-core-U22.04/latest_compiler_benchmarks_by_circuit.png?raw=true)

And here you can see progress over time, with new package versions labeled for each compiler:
![alt text](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc-bench/blob/main/results/ucc-benchmarks-8-core-U22.04/avg_compiler_benchmarks_over_time.png?raw=true)
where pytket-peep indicates the `FullPeepHoleOptimize` function of PyTKET.

The benchmark code, configurations and raw results from running on specific hardware are maintined in the companion repository of [`ucc-bench`](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc-bench).

To learn more about running these benchmarks, the overall benchmark philosophy, or how to contribute to improving the benchmarking methodology, check out the [benchmarking section](https://ucc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarking.html) in the docs or the `README.md` in [`ucc-bench`](https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc-bench).
