# Trigger PR workflow in ucc-bench to test the performance impact of these changes
# to the current baseline benchmark results, posting a comment back to the ucc PR
# with a summary.
# This will only be run if the PR has the label "preview-benchmark-results"
# and will be skipped if the label is removed.

# To trigger an event in the other repo, we had to install a GitHub app in the
# ucc-bench repo, and then add the app ID/private key as secrets to this repo
# so it could trigger the workflow. See
# https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/automating-projects-using-actions
# for details.
#
# NOTE - This uses the `pull_request_target` event, which runs in the context of the base branch rather than the PR branch.
# This means we can run on PRs initiated from forks. It's best practice to *not* run or checkout any code from the fork
# however, as it might contain malicious code. So this job only kicks off the ucc-bench workflow.

# We also use `github.event.pull_request.merge_commit_sha` as the commit to run the benchmarks on. This is a temporary
# merge commit created by GitHub when the PR is opened, and it represents what the code would look like if the PR were merged.
