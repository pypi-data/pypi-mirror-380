Developer Documentation
#######################

This document provides information for developers who want to contribute to the development of ``ucc``, as well as for maintainers.

Creating a release
==================

.. important::
    This section is intended for maintainers of the :code:`ucc` repository.

To release a new version of ``ucc`` on GitHub, follow the steps below.

1. **Bump the Version:**
    - Increment the version in ``pyproject.toml`` according to `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_.

1. **Draft a New Release on GitHub:**
    - You can generate an initial set of release notes using GitHub's `draft a release <https://github.com/unitaryfoundation/ucc/releases/new>`_. Update them as desired.
    - In the Choose a Tag dropdown, manually type the new version in the box, which will create the new tag upon publishing.
    - Do NOT publish the release yet! Wait until step 4 below.

2. **Update the CHANGELOG.md:**
    - Copy your draft release notes to the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
    
3. **Commit Changes:**
    - Make sure you've committed the version bump to `pyproject.toml` and updates to `CHANGELOG.md`
    - Open a PR to get the changes reviewed.

4. **Publish the New Release on GitHub:**
    - Navigate back to your Release draft from step 1.
    - Scroll down and check the box labeled "Create a discussion for this release".
    - Click the Publish the Release.

.. tip::
    Ensure that all changes pass the tests, and the documentation builds correctly before creating a release.


Publishing a new version of UCC to PyPI (maintainers only)
==========================================================
1. Follow the steps above for creating a new release.
2. The deployment to TestPyPI should trigger automatically (only maintainers will have access).
3. Run a test of the TestPyPI deployment on your local machine:
    a. Create a new Python environment â‰¥ our latest required version, e.g. ``python3.13 -m venv ~/.venvs/test_ucc``
    b. Activate the new environment with ``source ~/.venvs/test_ucc/bin/activate``.
    c. Run ``pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ ucc``
       to install from the TestPyPI deployment
    d. Run ``python -c "import ucc; print(ucc.__version__)"``.
       This should run successfully and show the latest version of UCC.
4. If all went well in the TestPyPI step, you (as a maintainer) can go to the GH Actions and approve the deployment to real PyPI.
   If for some reason this does not work, or fails to trigger on a release, you can also manually trigger the workflow in the Github Actions tab:
