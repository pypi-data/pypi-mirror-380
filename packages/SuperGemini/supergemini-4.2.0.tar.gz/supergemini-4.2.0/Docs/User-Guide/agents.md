## Core Concepts

### What are SuperGemini Agents?
**Agents** are specialized AI domain experts with focused expertise in specific technical areas. Each agent has unique knowledge, behavioral patterns, and problem-solving approaches tailored to their domain.

**Auto-Activation** means agents automatically engage based on keywords, file types, and task complexity without manual selection. The system analyzes your request and routes to the most appropriate specialists.

**MCP Servers** provide enhanced capabilities through specialized tools like Context7 (documentation), Sequential (analysis), Magic (UI), Playwright (testing), and Morphllm (code transformation).

**Domain Specialists** focus on narrow expertise areas to provide deeper, more accurate solutions than generalist approaches.

### Agent Selection Rules

**Priority Hierarchy:**
1. **Keywords** - Direct domain terminology triggers primary agents
2. **File Types** - Extensions activate language/framework specialists  
3. **Complexity** - Multi-step tasks engage coordination agents
4. **Context** - Related concepts trigger complementary agents

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Multiple matches → Multi-agent coordination
- Unclear context → Requirements analyst activation
- High complexity → System architect oversight
- Quality concerns → Automatic QA agent inclusion

**Selection Decision Tree:**
```
Task Analysis →
├─ Single Domain? → Activate primary agent
├─ Multi-Domain? → Coordinate specialist agents  
├─ Complex System? → Add system-architect oversight
├─ Quality Critical? → Include security + performance + quality agents
└─ Learning Focus? → Add learning-guide + technical-writer
```

## Quick Start Examples

**Automatic Agent Coordination:**
```bash
# Triggers: security-engineer + backend-architect + quality-engineer
/sg:implement "JWT authentication with rate limiting"

# Triggers: frontend-architect + learning-guide + technical-writer  
/sg:design "accessible React dashboard with documentation"

# Triggers: devops-architect + performance-engineer + root-cause-analyst
/sg:troubleshoot "slow deployment pipeline with intermittent failures"

# Triggers: security-engineer + quality-engineer + refactoring-expert
/sg:audit "payment processing security vulnerabilities"
```

- **Quality Keywords**: Add "security", "performance", "accessibility" for comprehensive coverage

**Request Optimization Examples:**
```bash
# Generic (limited agent activation)
"Fix the login feature"

# Optimized (multi-agent coordination)  
"Implement secure JWT authentication with rate limiting and accessibility compliance"
# → Triggers: security-engineer + backend-architect + frontend-architect + quality-engineer
```

### Common Usage Patterns

**Development Workflows:**
```bash
# Full-stack feature development
/sg:implement "responsive user dashboard with real-time notifications"
# → frontend-architect + backend-architect + performance-engineer

# API development with documentation
/sg:create "REST API for payment processing with comprehensive docs"  
# → backend-architect + security-engineer + technical-writer + quality-engineer

# Performance optimization investigation
/sg:troubleshoot "slow database queries affecting user experience"
# → performance-engineer + root-cause-analyst + backend-architect
```

**Analysis Workflows:**
```bash
# Security assessment
/sg:analyze "authentication system for GDPR compliance vulnerabilities"
# → security-engineer + quality-engineer + requirements-analyst

# Code quality review  
/sg:review "legacy codebase for modernization opportunities"
# → refactoring-expert + system-architect + quality-engineer + technical-writer

# Learning and explanation
/sg:explain "microservices patterns with hands-on examples"
# → system-architect + learning-guide + technical-writer
```

**Collaborative Intelligence**: Multi-agent coordination produces synergistic results that exceed individual agent capabilities.

**Adaptive Learning**: Agent selection improves based on request patterns and successful coordination outcomes.

### Agent vs. Traditional AI

**Traditional Approach**: Single AI handles all domains with varying levels of expertise
**Agent Approach**: Specialized experts collaborate with deep domain knowledge and focused problem-solving

**Benefits**:
- Higher accuracy in domain-specific tasks
- More sophisticated problem-solving methodologies  
- Better quality assurance through specialist review
- Coordinated multi-perspective analysis

### Trust the System, Understand the Patterns

**What to Expect**:
- Automatic routing to appropriate domain experts
- Multi-agent coordination for complex tasks
- Quality integration through automatic QA agent inclusion
- Learning opportunities through educational agent activation

**What Not to Worry About**:
- Manual agent selection or configuration
