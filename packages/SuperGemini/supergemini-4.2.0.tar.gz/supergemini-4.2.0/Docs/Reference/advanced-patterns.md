## Agent Coordination Excellence

### Multi-Agent Workflow Optimization

**Frontend + Backend + Security Coordination:**
```bash
# Optimal coordination for full-stack features
/sg:implement "secure user dashboard with real-time updates"

# Automatic activation and coordination:
# 1. security-engineer: Establishes security requirements and authentication patterns
# 2. backend-architect: Designs API with security validation and real-time capabilities
# 3. frontend-architect: Creates responsive UI with security compliance
# 4. Context7 MCP: Provides official patterns for frameworks and security libraries

# Coordination benefits:
# - Security requirements integrated from the start
# - API design optimized for frontend consumption
# - Real-time features implemented with security considerations
# - Modern UI patterns with accessibility compliance

# Results: Improved security integration and faster development through coordination
```

**Performance + Architecture + DevOps Coordination:**
```bash
# System optimization requiring multiple specialists
/sg:improve "microservices platform performance under load"

# Specialist coordination:
# 1. performance-engineer: Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
# 2. system-architect: Evaluates architectural patterns and service communication
# 3. devops-architect: Assesses infrastructure scaling and deployment optimization
# 4. Sequential MCP: Provides systematic analysis and hypothesis testing

# Outcomes: Comprehensive optimization across application and infrastructure layers
```

**Quality + Security + Documentation Coordination:**
```bash
# Production readiness with comprehensive validation
/sg:analyze . --focus security --comprehensive --export production-audit

# Multi-agent validation:
# 1. security-engineer: Security audit and vulnerability assessment
# 2. quality-engineer: Quality metrics and testing completeness
# 3. technical-writer: Documentation completeness and clarity
# 4. All agents collaborate on production readiness checklist

# Value: Production-ready validation with comprehensive documentation
```

### Advanced Agent Selection Patterns

**Keyword Strategy for Precise Agent Activation:**
```bash
# Generic request (suboptimal agent selection)
/sg:implement "user system"
# May activate generic backend-architect only

# Optimized request (precise agent selection)
/sg:implement "secure user authentication with JWT, rate limiting, and audit logging"
# Activates: security-engineer + backend-architect + quality-engineer
# Keywords: "secure", "authentication", "rate limiting", "audit" trigger specialists

# Domain-specific optimization
/sg:implement "React TypeScript component library with Storybook and accessibility"
# Activates: frontend-architect + technical-writer + quality-engineer
# Keywords: "React", "TypeScript", "accessibility" ensure proper specialists
```

**Agent Hierarchy and Leadership Patterns:**
```bash
# Security-led development (security requirements drive implementation)
/sg:implement "payment processing system" --lead-agent security-engineer
# Security-engineer establishes requirements, others implement within constraints

# Architecture-led development (design drives implementation)
/sg:design "microservices architecture" --lead-agent system-architect
/sg:implement "service implementation" --follow-architecture
# Architecture decisions guide all implementation choices
