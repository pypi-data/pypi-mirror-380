# Changelog

All notable changes to SuperGemini will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.2.0] - 2025-09-26

### Fixed
- Enhanced MCP prerequisite detection to reliably locate `node`, `npm`, and `uv` across common version managers and PATH fallbacks, preventing false "not found" errors during installation (`setup/components/mcp.py`).

### Changed
- Synchronized all published artifacts (PyPI + npm) and documentation with version `4.2.0`, ensuring installers and badges reference the corrected release.

## [4.0.9] - 2025-08-24

### Removed
- **AGENTS.md reference-only file**: Removed from installation and git tracking per v4.0.8 architecture
- **Agent file imports**: Removed @AGENTS.md from Core Framework imports in GEMINI.md

### Technical Details
- AGENTS.md excluded from component file discovery (setup/core/base.py)
- Added AGENTS.md to .gitignore and removed from git tracking
- Core component now installs 3 files instead of 4 (FLAGS.md, PRINCIPLES.md, RULES.md only)
- Agent expertise remains integrated in TOML command prompts as designed

## [4.0.8] - 2025-08-24

### Fixed
- **Serena folder auto-creation**: Removed unnecessary directory creation during MCP installation
- **Logger error during uninstall**: Fixed custom Logger wrapper attribute access issue preventing clean uninstall
- **Uninstall completeness**: Enhanced file removal process with proper log handler cleanup

### Technical Details
- MCP component no longer creates serena directory unnecessarily (setup/components/mcp.py)
- Uninstall command properly accesses internal logger handlers through wrapper (setup/cli/commands/uninstall.py)
- Both issues identified and resolved through root cause analysis

## [4.0.7] - 2025-08-24

### Removed  
- **BREAKING**: Simple persona system replaced with specialized agent architecture
- **BREAKING**: Basic MCP integration replaced with advanced 6-server ecosystem
- Legacy hook system removed (Gemini CLI incompatibility)
- SuperGemini/Core/ complexity reduced from 9 files to 4 files for streamlined operation

### Technical Details
- Commands accessible as `/sg:analyze`, `/sg:build`, `/sg:improve`, `/sg:implement`, etc.
- Agent expertise integrated directly into command execution for Gemini single-agent optimization
- MCP servers auto-selected based on operation type: Serena (semantic), Morphllm (bulk), Magic (UI)
- Behavioral modes activate automatically based on context: complexity, scope, performance needs
- Session workflow: `/sg:load` → work → periodic checkpoints → `/sg:save` for continuity
- Memory schema supports plan/phase/task/todo hierarchy with cross-session preservation

### Migration Guide
- **Command Migration**: All `/sg:` commands maintain backward compatibility with enhanced functionality
- **Agent Learning**: 13 specialized agents replace simple personas - review agent capabilities for optimal usage
- **Session Workflow**: Adopt `/sg:load` → work → `/sg:save` pattern for cross-session continuity
- **MCP Integration**: Install Serena and Morphllm MCP servers for advanced semantic and bulk operations
- **Performance**: Leverage behavioral modes for improved efficiency in complex operations
