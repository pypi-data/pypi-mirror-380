THIS-737 Add Property model (#1301)

# Description

Context: We are changing the internal structure of the neat data models.
We are replacing flat conceptual data model structure with nested for
easier manipulation of data model as well conversion of conceptual data
model to DMS API representation. Also, we are dropping "unverified"
state of data model, resulting in more simple data model representation.

In this PR we are defining conceptual data model Property model.

Note: most of the code is test and docstring
