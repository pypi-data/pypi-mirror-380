SQLsaber offers multiple ways to query your database using natural language. This guide covers all the different query modes and their use cases.

### Interactive Mode

Ideal for back and forth conversations about your data.

```bash
saber
```

<script
  src="https://asciinema.org/a/739399.js"
  id="asciicast-739399"
  async="true"
></script>

### Single Query Mode

Run a one-off query without entering interactive mode:

```bash
saber "How many orders were placed last week?"
```

Useful for:

- Shell scripting
- Quick checks
- Automated reporting

### Stdin Mode

Pipe queries from other commands or files:

```bash
# From echo
echo "Count all active customers from last week" | saber

# From file
cat query.txt | saber

# From other commands
curl -s https://api.example.com/query | saber
```

Useful for:

- Shell scripting
- Batch processing
- Integration with other tools
- Automation

### Features

#### Slash Commands

Special commands in interactive mode:

- `/clear` - Clear conversation history
- `/exit` or `/quit` - Exit SQLsaber

```
> /clear
Conversation history cleared.

> /exit
Goodbye!
```

#### Table Autocomplete

Type `@` followed by a table name to get autocomplete suggestions:

```
> Show me all records from @cus[TAB]
> Show me all records from @customers
```

Supports schema-aware completions:

```
> @pub[TAB] â†’ @public.customers
```

### Database Selection

#### Using Default

If you have a default database configured:

```bash
saber "Show me sales data"
```

#### Specifying Database by Name

Use a configured database connection:

```bash
saber -d prod-db "What's our revenue this month?"
```

#### Using Files Directly

Work with SQLite, DuckDB, or CSV files directly:

```bash
# SQLite file
saber -d "./data/sales.db" "Top selling products"

# DuckDB file
saber -d "./data/warehouse.duckdb" "Latest partitions"

# CSV file
saber -d "./customers.csv" "How many customers per state?"
```

#### Connection Strings

Use connection strings for temporary connections:

```bash
saber -d "postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db" "Count all users"
```

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Test the connection
saber db test my-database

# Check database list
saber db list
```
