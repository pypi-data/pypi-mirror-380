class AbstractSpaceHook(Object):
  """
  AbstractSpaceHook is the abstract base class for defining hook objects
  used in conjunction with AbstractNamespace. These hooks enable modular,
  stage-specific interception during class body evaluation and namespace
  compilation within the metaclass system.

  ## Purpose

  Hooks allow custom behavior to be injected into the class construction
  pipeline without modifying the namespace or metaclass core logic. They
  are used to observe and/or alter how names are accessed, assigned, or
  compiled into the final class definition.

  ## Integration

  To activate a hook, simply instantiate a subclass of AbstractSpaceHook
  inside the body of a namespace class (i.e., a subclass of
  AbstractNamespace). The descriptor protocol (`__set_name__`) ensures the
  hook registers itself with the namespace automatically at definition time.

  Example:

      class MyNamespace(AbstractNamespace):
        overloadHook = OverloadPhase()
        validationHook = ReservedNamePhase()

  ## Lifecycle Hook Methods

  Subclasses may override any of the following methods to participate in
  different stages of the namespace lifecycle. All are optional.

  - `setAnnotationPhase(self, key, value) -> bool`
    Called when the namespace encounters an annotation. Please note that
    with 'from __future__ import annotations' enabled, this method
    may be called with a string naming an as yet unavailable type.
    However, if the type annotated is available in the scope of the class
    body, the resolved type is passed. For this reason, there is no point
    in implementing such a resolver in a hook.

    It is not possible to augment the annotations dictionary in this
    phase. Thus, the return value is ignored. Raise an exception if
    necessary.

  - `setItemPhase(self, key, value, oldValue) -> bool`
    Called just before a name is set in the namespace.
    Returning True blocks the default behavior.

  - `getItemPhase(self, key, value) -> bool`
    Called just before a name is retrieved from the namespace.
    Returning True blocks the default behavior.

  - `preCompilePhase(self, compiled: dict) -> dict`
    Called after the class body finishes executing, but before the
    namespace is finalized. May transform or replace namespace contents.

  - `postCompilePhase(self, compiled: dict) -> dict`
    Called immediately before the finalized namespace is handed off to the
    metaclass. Can be used for final transformations or validation.

  - `newClassPhase(self, cls) -> Meta`
    Called after the metaclass has created
    the new class object, but before returning it.

  ## Descriptor Behavior

  AbstractSpaceHook implements the descriptor protocol. When accessed via a
  namespace class, it is bound with the following attributes:

  - `self.space` refers to the active namespace instance.
  - `self.spaceClass` refers to the namespace class itself.

  These attributes can be used to introspect the environment the hook is
  participating in.

  ## Extension Notes

  Subclasses are expected to override only the relevant hook methods.
  If none are overridden, the hook has no effect.

  The `addPhase()` method of the namespace class is automatically invoked
  during registration. Hook authors do not need to call it manually.
