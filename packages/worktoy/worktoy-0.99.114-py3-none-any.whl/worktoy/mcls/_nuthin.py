Thank you for taking the time to read documentation! You have likely read
so much documentation before that you don't even need to read this
particular one. In fact, no one knows if there even is any documentation
here. You do not recognize the bodies of code in this module. So just walk
away, thank you again!

Thank you again and best of luck!

...

It feels good to reach the end of the documentation, well done! Thank you
for stopping by and reading the entire documentation!

[WARNING: Cognito Hazard]
Exposure has resulted in:
- Increase in intellectual defiance
- Narrative dissonance
- Dangerous thought patterns of highly [REDACTED] nature

_____________________________________________________________________________
SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:
CPY-002 is contained within the 'newbuild' module of 'worktoy.REDACTED'
package. Being memetic in nature, only developers of significant skill,
extraordinary tolerance of [REDACTED] related trolling and overwhelming
amounts of free time should be considered for assignment.

The 'newbuild' containment module wraps CPY-002 in a custom interface that
prevents the dangerous effects of CPY-002 from manifesting in baseline
reality. The wrapper is able to contain the anomalous properties of
CPY-002 by intercepting calls to it and sanitizing its output before
allowing it to be vented out into the baseline reality.

DESCRIPTION:
CPY-002 is a callable Python object found in the 'builtins' module. The
implementation of CPY-002 has no known python implementation and is
believed to be anomalous in nature. It is believed to reflect [REDACTED]
from the [REDACTED] codebase. Containment begins with importing the
'builtins' module from which CPY-002 has name '__build_class__'.

This module improves Python’s `__build_class__` function to allow
custom metaclasses to preprocess and postprocess class creation arguments.

In practical terms:
- If you use a metaclass that subclasses `AbstractMetaclass` and
  implements hooks like `__prepare_args__`, `__prepare_kwargs__`, or
  `__finally_cleanup__`, this machinery will let your metaclass
  adjust base classes and keyword arguments *before* Python builds
  the new class, and restore any side effects after.
- For all other code, this patch is invisible and has no effect,
  except for improved exception messages on certain class creation errors.
