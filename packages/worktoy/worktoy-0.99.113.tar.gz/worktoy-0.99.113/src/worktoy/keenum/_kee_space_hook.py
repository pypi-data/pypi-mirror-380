"""
KeeSpaceHook collects the KeeMember objects encountered in the class
bodies of KeeNum classes. This happens during the 'setItemPhase'. To avoid
context leakage, the members are collected in the owning namespace object.
The namespace object is expected to implement a method called
'addEnumeration' which 'KeeHook' calls to register the members. The
'KeeHook' provides no further functionality than deciding what key,
value pairs to collect as future members of the enumeration.
