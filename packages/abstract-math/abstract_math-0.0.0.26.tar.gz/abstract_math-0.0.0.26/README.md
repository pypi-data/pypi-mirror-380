# abstract_math

## Description
The abstract_math Python module, currently in its Alpha development stage (version 0.0.0.14), is designed for performing complex mathematical operations and token manipulations. This module comprises primarily of two scripts: `safe_math` and `derive_tokens`.

## Features
- Performing complex mathematical operations.
- Manipulation and derivation of mathematical tokens, referred to as 'lamports'.
- High precision for decimal calculations for better accuracy.
- Functions for deriving quantities like lamports, virtual reserves, sol reserves, sol amounts, token reserves, token amounts, derived token ratio, price, and token decimals.
- Module components for updating Sol and token variables.

## Scripts Overview

- `derive_tokens.py`: This script is involved in the complex manipulation or derivation of mathematical tokens, referred to as 'lamports'. The functions defined in this script handle various aspects of token manipulations and calculations. 


## Installation
To install the abstract_math module, ensure that your Python version is 3.6 or later. This module currently does not have any external dependencies to be installed.

## Usage
This module could potentially be used as a framework for handling complex mathematical operations or token manipulations. Developers interested in working with and enhancing this module can access the source code at the repository (provide repo link here).

## Dependencies
