# CLIMADA

[CLIMADA](https://climada.ethz.ch/climada/) (CLIMate ADAptation) is a free and open-source software framework for climate risk assessment and adaptation
option appraisal. Designed by a large scientific community, it helps reasearchers, policymakers, and businesses analyse the impacts of natural hazards and
explore adaptation strategies.

As of today, CLIMADA provides global coverage of major climate-related extreme-weather hazards at high resolution (4x4km) via a [data API](https://climada.ethz.ch/data-api/v1/docs) For select hazards, historic and probabilistic events sets, for past, present and future climate exist at distinct time horizons.
You will find a repository containing scientific peer-reviewed articles that explain software components implemented in CLIMADA [here](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_papers).

CLIMADA is divided into two parts (two repositories):

1. the core [climada_python](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python) contains all the modules necessary for the probabilistic impact, the averted damage, uncertainty and forecast calculations. Data for hazard, exposures and impact functions can be obtained from the [data API](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_util_api_client.ipynb). [Litpop](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_entity_LitPop.ipynb) is included as demo Exposures module, and [Tropical cyclones](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/blob/main/doc/tutorial/climada_hazard_TropCyclone.ipynb) is included as a demo Hazard module.
2. the petals [climada_petals](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_petals) contains all the modules for generating data (e.g., TC_Surge, WildFire, OpenStreeMap, ...). Most development is done here. The petals builds-upon the core and does not work as a stand-alone.

For new users, we recommend to begin with the core (1) and the [tutorials](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/tree/main/doc/tutorial) therein.

This is the Python version of CLIMADA - please see [here](https://github.com/davidnbresch/climada) for backward compatibility with the MATLAB version.

## Getting started

CLIMADA runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.
The released versions of CLIMADA are available from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/climada).
Use the [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package manager to install it:

```shell
mamba install -c conda-forge climada
```

It is **highly recommended** to install CLIMADA into a **separate** Conda environment.
See the [installation guide](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/install.html) for further information.

Follow the [tutorials](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/1_main_climada.html) in a Jupyter Notebook to see what can be done with CLIMADA and how.

## Documentation

The online documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).The documentation of each release version of CLIMADA can be accessed separately through the drop-down menu at the bottom of the left sidebar. Additionally, the version 'stable' refers to the most recent release (installed via `conda`), and 'latest' refers to the latest unstable development version (the `develop` branch).
