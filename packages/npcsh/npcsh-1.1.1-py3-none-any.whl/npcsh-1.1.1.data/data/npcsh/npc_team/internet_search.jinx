jinx_name: internet_search
description: Searches the web for information based on a query in order to verify
  timiely details (e.g. current events) or to corroborate information in uncertain
  situations. Should be mainly only used when users specifically request a search,
  otherwise an LLMs basic knowledge should be sufficient. The Query must be written specifically
  as a search query, it should not be a direct parroting of the user's input text.  Returns a LLM summary so no post-summary is required
