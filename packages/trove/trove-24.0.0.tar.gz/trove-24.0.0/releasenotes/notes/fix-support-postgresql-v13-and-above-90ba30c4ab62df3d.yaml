    Fixes support for PostgreSQL v13 and above.
    Sets the `wal_keep_size` or `wal_keep_segments` in the instance
    configuration file depending on the version in the data store version name.
    The version number is parsed from the Datastore Version name and is exposed
    to the database instance configuration templates to allow the the use of
    conditional based on the version.
