features:
    - Support Alembic database migration tool.

upgrade:
    -  Trove has removed support for SQLAlchemy-Migrate. If users are
       upgrading from a version prior to "Wallaby," they need to first
       upgrade to a version between "Wallaby" and "Bobocat" using
       SQLAlchemy-Migrate to complete the database schema migration,
       and then use trove-manage to upgrade to the latest version.
