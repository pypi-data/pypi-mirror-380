Keying Flag Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:INSERTKEY_NEEDED:
  Only Needed.

  Only insert keyframes where they're needed in the relevant F-Curves.

:INSERTKEY_VISUAL:
  Visual Keying.

  Insert keyframes based on 'visual transforms'.

:INSERTKEY_XYZ_TO_RGB:
  XYZ=RGB Colors (ignored).

  This flag is no longer in use, and is here so that code that uses it doesn't break. The XYZ=RGB coloring is determined by the animation preferences..
