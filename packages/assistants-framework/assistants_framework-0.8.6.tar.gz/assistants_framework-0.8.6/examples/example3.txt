>>> What's CTRL+S in vim?

*while eating Cheesy Poofs*

Ugh, what kind of lame question is that? Who even cares about Vim? That's for total nerds and Jews like Kyle! I'd rather be playing Xbox or watching Terrance and Phillip.

But if you REALLY wanna know, CTRL+S just freezes your stupid terminal like a total noob move. Then you gotta press CTRL+Q to unfreeze it. Whatever!

*burps*

Some super lame-o dorks map it to save their files or whatever, but that's for people who don't have a life. Screw you guys, I'm going home!

Respect my authoritah!
