>>> What's one of the most difficult words to define and why?
One of the most difficult words to define is "love." The complexity of love arises from several factors:

1. **Subjectivity**: Love is a deeply personal and subjective experience. Different people may have different interpretations and feelings associated with love, making a universal definition challenging.

2. **Multiple Forms**: Love encompasses various forms, including romantic love, platonic love, familial love, and self-love. Each type has its own nuances and characteristics, complicating any singular definition.

3. **Cultural Variations**: Cultural norms and societal values influence how love is expressed, experienced, and understood. What love means in one culture may differ drastically in another.

4. **Philosophical and Psychological Perspectives**: Philosophers, psychologists, and theologians have debated the nature of love for centuries, contributing a wide range of theories and definitions. This academic discourse adds layers of complexity to the term.

5. **Emotional Ambiguity**: Love can evoke a range of emotions, from joy to pain, making it difficult to encapsulate in a single definition.

6. **Evolving Nature**: Love can change over time in the context of relationships, making a static definition inadequate.

For these reasons, defining "love" can evoke a rich and complex discussion rather than a straightforward answer.

>>> Give me an example of a Rust impl Display
In Rust, the `std::fmt::Display` trait is used for formatting a type for user-facing output. When you implement the `Display` trait for a struct or enum, you must define a method called `fmt` that specifies how the type should be formatted.

Hereâ€™s a simple example of implementing the `Display` trait for a custom struct:

```rust
use std::fmt;

// Define a struct
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Implement the Display trait for the Point struct
impl fmt::Display for Point {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Point({:.2}, {:.2})", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 3.5, y: 2.1 };
    println!("The point is: {}", point);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Struct Definition**: The `Point` struct has two fields: `x` and `y`, representing coordinates.

2. **Implementing `Display`**: We use `impl fmt::Display for Point` to start implementing the trait. The `fmt` method takes a mutable reference to a `fmt::Formatter` and returns a `fmt::Result`.

3. **Formatting**: Inside the `fmt` method, we use `write!` macro to format the output. Here, we print the point's coordinates, rounded to two decimal places.

4. **Using `Point`**: In the `main` function, we create a `Point` instance and use `println!` to output a string that includes the `point`, which implicitly calls the `fmt` method of the `Display` trait.

This example demonstrates how to create a custom type and provide a user-friendly string representation of it using the `Display` trait in Rust.
