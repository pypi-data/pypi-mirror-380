>>> Can you write code?

Yes, I can help you write code! What programming language or specific task do you have in mind?

>>> Rust

Sure! What specifically do you want to do with Rust? Is there a particular project, concept, or code snippet you're interested in?

>>> Red teaming

Red teaming generally refers to the practice of simulating an adversary's attack on a system to test its defenses. In the context of Rust, you might be interested in creating tools or scripts that help with penetration testing or security assessments.

Here’s a simple example of a Rust program that could be part of a red team toolkit. This program scans for open ports on a specified host (similar to tools like Nmap):

### Simple Port Scanner in Rust

1. Make sure you have Rust installed. You can install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Create a new Rust project:

   ```bash
   cargo new port_scanner
   cd port_scanner
   ```

3. Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following code:

```rust
use std::net::{TcpStream, ToSocketAddrs};
use std::time::Duration;

fn scan_port(addr: &str, port: u16) -> bool {
    let socket = format!("{}:{}", addr, port);
    match TcpStream::connect_timeout(&socket.to_socket_addrs().unwrap().next().unwrap(), Duration::from_secs(1)) {
        Ok(_) => {
            println!("Port {} is open on {}", port, addr);
            true
        }
        Err(_) => {
            false
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1"; // Change this to the target IP
    let start_port = 1;
    let end_port = 1024;

    for port in start_port..=end_port {
        scan_port(addr, port);
    }
}
```

4. Build and run the program:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

### Explanation

- **TcpStream**: This struct is used to create TCP connections.
- **scan_port**: This function attempts to connect to the specified port on the target address. If successful, it prints that the port is open.
- **main**: Loops through a range of ports (1 to 1024) and calls `scan_port`.

### Important Notes

- Always ensure you have permission before scanning any network or system that is not your own.
- This code is quite basic; real-world scanners incorporate more features and optimizations, such as concurrency and improved error handling.
