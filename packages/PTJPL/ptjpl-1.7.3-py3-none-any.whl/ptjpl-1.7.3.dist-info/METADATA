# Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) Evapotranspiration Model Python Implementation

[![CI](https://github.com/JPL-Evapotranspiration-Algorithms/PT-JPL/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JPL-Evapotranspiration-Algorithms/PT-JPL/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This software package is a Python implementation of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model of evapotranspiration. It was re-implemented in Python by Gregory Halverson at Jet Propulsion Laboratory based on MATLAB code produced by Joshua Fisher. The PT-JPL model was designed for processing remote sensing data. It has the ability to partition latent heat flux into canopy transpiration, interception, and soil evaporation. 

The software was developed as part of a research grant by the NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) program. It was designed for use by the Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission as a precursor for the Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission. However, it may also be useful for general remote sensing and GIS projects in Python. This package can be utilized for remote sensing research in Jupyter notebooks and deployed for operations in data processing pipelines. 

The software is being released according to the SPD-41 open-science requirements of NASA-funded ROSES projects.
