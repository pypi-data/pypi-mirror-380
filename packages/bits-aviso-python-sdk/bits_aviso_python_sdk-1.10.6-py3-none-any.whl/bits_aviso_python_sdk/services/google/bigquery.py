"""
This module provides a class to interact with Google BigQuery. Currently, it only supports executing queries.
If no service account credentials are provided, the SDK will attempt to use the default credentials.

## Usage
The following is an example of how to execute a query in BigQuery:

```python

from bits_aviso_python_sdk.services.google.bigquery import BigQuery

# initialize BigQuery client
bigquery_client = BigQuery()

# query
query = "SELECT * FROM `your_project_id.your_dataset_id.your_table_id`"

# execute query
result = bigquery_client.query(query)
```
