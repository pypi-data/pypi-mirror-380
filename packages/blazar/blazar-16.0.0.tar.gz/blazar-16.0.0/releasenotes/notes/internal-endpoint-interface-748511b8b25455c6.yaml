    Requests to other OpenStack services are now made using the internal
    interface instead of the public interface. This fixes issues when public
    endpoints are not reachable by Blazar. For more details, see `bug 1960335
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/blazar/+bug/1960335>`_.

    This can be configured with the following options:

    * ``[DEFAULT]/endpoint_type`` to configure the Keystone endpoint type
    * ``[neutron]/endpoint_type`` to configure the Neutron endpoint type
    * ``[nova]/endpoint_type`` to configure the Nova endpoint type
    * ``[placement]/endpoint_type`` to configure the Placement endpoint type
