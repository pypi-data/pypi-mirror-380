    Add a new resource type ``flavor:instance`` to reserve instances based on
    existing flavors. This is implemented by a new plugin named
    ``flavor.instance.plugin``. Note that this feature is available as a
    preview but is not yet complete. See `documentation
    <https://docs.openstack.org/blazar/latest/user/architecture.html>`__ for
    more details.
