    Fixes a bug where any user could update/delete a lease from any project,
    provided that they had the lease ID. When using the default policy
    configuration, there is no way for a regular user to see lease IDs of
    another project. However, operators that are running the Resource
    Availability Calendar may have overridden this policy, and so may be
    vulnerable without this fix.
