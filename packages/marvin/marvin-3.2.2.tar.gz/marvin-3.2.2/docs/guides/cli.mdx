# Marvin CLI

Marvin comes with a powerful command-line interface that helps you interact with AI capabilities right from your terminal. This guide shows you how to use the CLI for everyday tasks and advanced operations.

<Tip>
If you're new to Marvin, the CLI is often the fastest way to experiment with its capabilities!
</Tip>

## Getting Started

The CLI is bundled with Marvin, so you already have it if you've installed the package:

```bash
pip install marvin
```

To check if everything's working properly, try running:

```bash
marvin version
```

## Core Commands

### Version Check

When you need to know which version you're running or for troubleshooting:

```bash
marvin version
```

<Accordion title="Example Output">
```
Marvin version:     0.12.0
Pydantic AI version: 0.7.1
Python version:     3.10.12
Platform:          macOS-14.1.1-arm64-arm-64bit
Path:              ~/Developer/marvin
```
</Accordion>

### The Versatile `x` Command

The `x` command is your Swiss Army knife for working with AI. You can use it to extract information, cast data to different types, or generate content â€” all through the power of large language models.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Extract Data
echo "Apples cost $2.50, oranges cost $3.00, and bananas cost $1.75" | marvin x -t "list[float]"
```

```bash Cast Types
echo "42.5" | marvin x -o cast -t "int"
```

```bash Generate Content
echo "Write a haiku about coding" | marvin x -o generate -t "str"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Example Outputs">
```json Extract Result
[2.5, 3.0, 1.75]
```

```json Cast Result
42
```

```json Generate Result
"Fingers on keyboard\nLogic flows through silent thoughts\nCode brings dreams to life"
```
</Accordion>

#### What can you do with it?

The `x` command fits perfectly into data pipelines and shell scripts. You can:

- Extract structured data from unstructured text
- Convert between data types intelligently
- Generate content based on instructions

<Info>
The `x` command is designed to be part of Unix pipelines. It reads from stdin and outputs JSON to stdout, so you can easily chain it with tools like `jq` for further processing.
</Info>

#### Command Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-o, --operation` | Operation to perform (`extract`, `cast`, or `generate`) | `extract` |
| `-t, --type` | Target type (use Python syntax like `str`, `int`, `list[str]`) | `str` |
| `-i, --instructions` | Custom instructions for the operation | None |
| `-n, --n` | Number of results to generate (only for `generate`) | 1 |

#### Real-world Examples

<CodeGroup>
```bash Extract Prices
# Get a list of prices from text
echo "Our products: Widget ($19.99), Gadget ($24.50), Thingamajig ($15)" | \
marvin x -t "list[float]" | jq
```

```bash Parse Dates
# Extract and standardize dates
echo "Meeting on Jan 5th, followup on February 10" | \
marvin x -t "list[datetime]" | jq
```

```bash Name Extraction
# Extract people's names from text
echo "Report prepared by John Smith and reviewed by Jane Doe" | \
marvin x -t "list[str]" -i "Extract people's names" | jq
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Example Outputs">
```json Price Extraction
[19.99, 24.50, 15.0]
```

```json Date Parsing
["2024-01-05T00:00:00", "2024-02-10T00:00:00"]
```

```json Name Extraction
["John Smith", "Jane Doe"]
```
</Accordion>

## Database Management

Marvin's CLI includes powerful commands for managing the database that stores your AI interactions, threads, and more.

<Warning>
Always back up your database before running migrations in production environments!
</Warning>

### Quick Commands

<CodeGroup>
```bash Check Status
# See your database status
marvin db status
```

```bash Apply Migrations
# Update your database schema
marvin db upgrade
```

```bash View History
# See migration history
marvin db history
```
</CodeGroup>

<Accordion title="Example Output">
```
DATABASE CONFIGURATION
Database URL:     sqlite:///home/user/.marvin/marvin.db
Database Type:    SQLite

MIGRATION STATUS
Current Revision: e772a112ae87
Head Revision:    e772a112ae87
Status:           Database is up to date
```
</Accordion>

For complete details on database management, check out the [Database Migrations](./database-migrations.mdx) guide.

## Developer Tools

If you're developing with Marvin or contributing to the project, you'll find these commands particularly helpful.

### Development Commands

The `dev` subcommand contains tools specifically designed for development purposes:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Create Migration
# Create an empty migration
marvin dev db revision -m "Add user settings"
```

```bash Auto Migration
# Auto-generate migration based on model changes
marvin dev db revision --autogenerate -m "Add timestamps"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
When using `--autogenerate`, always review the generated migration scripts before applying them. Automatic detection might miss complex changes or relationships.
</Tip>

## CLI Power Techniques

### Environment Variables

You can customize Marvin's behavior for a single command by setting environment variables:

```bash
MARVIN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG marvin db status
```

Common variables:
- `MARVIN_LOG_LEVEL`: Control logging verbosity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, etc.)
- `MARVIN_DATABASE_URL`: Override the database connection string
- `MARVIN_AI_PROVIDER`: Change the AI provider for the session

### Piping with jq

The `jq` tool pairs perfectly with Marvin's CLI for processing JSON output:

```bash
# Extract data and get just the first item
echo "orange, apple, banana" | marvin x -t "list[str]" | jq '.[0]'

# Generate multiple items and format as a comma-separated list
echo "planets" | marvin x -o generate -t "list[str]" -n 1 | jq -r '.[]' | paste -sd,
```

<Accordion title="Example Output">
```
"orange"
```

```
Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars,Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptune
```
</Accordion>

### Scripting with Marvin

You can integrate Marvin into your shell scripts for powerful automation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example: Summarize a file with Marvin
cat long_document.txt | marvin x -o generate -t "str" -i "Summarize this text" > summary.txt
```

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Common Issues">
### Command not found
Make sure Marvin is installed and your PATH includes the Python bin directory.

### Error with the x command
When using the `x` command with debug logging enabled, you might see an error. Try:
```bash
MARVIN_LOG_LEVEL=CRITICAL marvin x -t "str"
```

### Database connection issues
Check your database URL configuration with `marvin db status`.
</Accordion>

## Get Help

The CLI has built-in help for all commands. Just add `--help` to any command:

```bash
marvin --help
marvin x --help
marvin db --help
```
