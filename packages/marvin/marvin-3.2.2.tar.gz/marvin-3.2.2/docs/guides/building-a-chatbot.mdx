In this guide, we'll build a conversational assistant (chatbot) using Marvin. Our assistant will:

1. Maintain conversation context across multiple turns
2. Remember user preferences and facts
3. Respond in a consistent persona
4. Access external data when needed

This is a common use case for Marvin, and demonstrates how to combine threads, memory, agents, and tools into a cohesive application.

## Setting Up

First, ensure you have Marvin installed:

```bash
pip install marvin
```

Set up your API key (OpenAI is used by default):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Creating the Assistant

Let's start by defining our assistant's persona and capabilities:

```python
import marvin
from marvin import Agent, Memory, Thread

# Create a memory for user preferences
user_memory = Memory(
    key="user_preferences",
    instructions="Remember information about the user, including their name, preferences, and any personal details they share."
)

# Create a memory for factual knowledge
knowledge_memory = Memory(
    key="assistant_knowledge",
    instructions="Store factual information about the world, products, services, or any domain-specific knowledge."
)

# Define our assistant
assistant = Agent(
    name="Helpful Assistant",
    instructions="""
    You are a friendly, helpful assistant. 
    Your tone is conversational but professional.
    Always be truthful and admit when you don't know something.
    If the user asks about preferences they've previously shared, refer to them.
    """,
    memories=[user_memory, knowledge_memory]
)
```

## Basic Conversation Loop

Now, let's implement a simple conversation loop:

```python
def chat():
    """Run a conversation with the assistant."""
    print("âœ¨ Assistant: Hello! How can I help you today? (type 'exit' to quit)")
    
    # Create a thread to maintain conversation context
    with Thread() as thread:
        while True:
            # Get user input
            user_input = input("ðŸ§‘ You: ")
            
            # Check for exit command
            if user_input.lower() in ('exit', 'quit', 'bye'):
                print("âœ¨ Assistant: Goodbye! Have a great day!")
                break
            
            # Process the input and get a response
            response = assistant.run(user_input)
            
            # Display the response
            print(f"âœ¨ Assistant: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chat()
```

Try running this code and having a conversation. The assistant will remember information from earlier in the conversation because of the Thread context.

## Adding External Tools

Let's enhance our assistant by giving it some tools to access external information:

```python
import datetime
import requests

def get_current_time() -> str:
    """Get the current date and time."""
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    return now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a location (simulated)."""
    # In a real app, you'd use a weather API
    return f"It's currently sunny and 72Â°F in {location}."

def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information (simulated)."""
    # In a real app, you'd use a search API
    return f"Here are some results for '{query}': [simulated search results]"

# Update our assistant with tools
assistant = Agent(
    name="Helpful Assistant",
    instructions="""
    You are a friendly, helpful assistant. 
    Your tone is conversational but professional.
    Always be truthful and admit when you don't know something.
    If the user asks about preferences they've previously shared, refer to them.
    Use your tools when needed to provide up-to-date information.
    """,
    memories=[user_memory, knowledge_memory],
    tools=[get_current_time, get_weather, search_web]
)
```

Now when the user asks for the time, weather, or information that might be found online, the assistant can provide that information.

## Persistent Personalization

Let's add some code to initialize the assistant with personalized knowledge about the user:

```python
import asyncio

async def initialize_assistant(name: str, preferences: dict = None):
    """Initialize the assistant with knowledge about the user."""
    # Add basic information about the user
    await user_memory.add(f"The user's name is {name}.")
    
    # Add preferences if provided
    if preferences:
        for category, pref in preferences.items():
            await user_memory.add(f"The user prefers {pref} for {category}.")
    
    print(f"Assistant initialized for user: {name}")

# Example usage
async def setup():
    await initialize_assistant(
        name="Alex",
        preferences={
            "communication style": "concise",
            "topics": "technology and science",
            "greeting": "Hi there"
        }
    )

# Run the setup
asyncio.run(setup())
```

After running this initialization, the assistant will remember the user's name and preferences across conversations, even if you restart the program (as long as the memory database persists).

## Complete Implementation

Here's the complete code for our conversational assistant:

```python
import marvin
from marvin import Agent, Memory, Thread
import asyncio
import datetime

# Create memories
user_memory = Memory(
    key="user_preferences",
    instructions="Remember information about the user, including their name, preferences, and any personal details they share."
)

knowledge_memory = Memory(
    key="assistant_knowledge",
    instructions="Store factual information about the world, products, services, or any domain-specific knowledge."
)

# Define tools
def get_current_time() -> str:
    """Get the current date and time."""
    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    return now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a location (simulated)."""
    # In a real app, you'd use a weather API
    return f"It's currently sunny and 72Â°F in {location}."

def search_web(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web for information (simulated)."""
    # In a real app, you'd use a search API
    return f"Here are some results for '{query}': [simulated search results]"

# Create the assistant
assistant = Agent(
    name="Helpful Assistant",
    instructions="""
    You are a friendly, helpful assistant. 
    Your tone is conversational but professional.
    Always be truthful and admit when you don't know something.
    If the user asks about preferences they've previously shared, refer to them.
    Use your tools when needed to provide up-to-date information.
    """,
    memories=[user_memory, knowledge_memory],
    tools=[get_current_time, get_weather, search_web]
)

async def initialize_assistant(name: str, preferences: dict = None):
    """Initialize the assistant with knowledge about the user."""
    # Add basic information about the user
    await user_memory.add(f"The user's name is {name}.")
    
    # Add preferences if provided
    if preferences:
        for category, pref in preferences.items():
            await user_memory.add(f"The user prefers {pref} for {category}.")
    
    print(f"Assistant initialized for user: {name}")

def chat():
    """Run a conversation with the assistant."""
    print("âœ¨ Assistant: Hello! How can I help you today? (type 'exit' to quit)")
    
    # Create a thread to maintain conversation context
    with Thread(id="user_conversation") as thread:
        while True:
            # Get user input
            user_input = input("ðŸ§‘ You: ")
            
            # Check for exit command
            if user_input.lower() in ('exit', 'quit', 'bye'):
                print("âœ¨ Assistant: Goodbye! Have a great day!")
                break
            
            # Process the input and get a response
            response = assistant.run(user_input)
            
            # Display the response
            print(f"âœ¨ Assistant: {response}")

async def main():
    # Initialize with user info (only needed once)
    await initialize_assistant(
        name="Alex",
        preferences={
            "communication style": "concise",
            "topics": "technology and science",
            "greeting": "Hi there"
        }
    )
    
    # Start the chat
    chat()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Enhancing the Assistant

Here are some ways to enhance your conversational assistant:

### Multiple Specialized Agents

For more complex assistants, you can create a team of specialized agents:

```python
researcher = Agent(name="Researcher", instructions="Research facts thoroughly")
writer = Agent(name="Writer", instructions="Write engaging, clear responses")
fact_checker = Agent(name="Fact Checker", instructions="Verify information for accuracy")

from marvin import Swarm
assistant_team = Swarm([researcher, writer, fact_checker])

# Use the team instead of a single agent
response = assistant_team.run(user_input)
```

### Adding a Web Interface

You can integrate your assistant with a web framework like FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
import uvicorn
import json

app = FastAPI()

# Serve a simple HTML page with a chat interface
@app.get("/")
async def get():
    html = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Marvin Chat</title>
            <style>
                #chat { margin: 0 auto; width: 600px; }
                #messages { height: 400px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; }
                #input { width: 500px; padding: 5px; }
                .user { color: blue; }
                .assistant { color: green; }
            </style>

                <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
            </div>
            <script>
                const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8000/ws");
                
                ws.onmessage = function(event) {
                    const messages = document.getElementById('messages');
                    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
                    messages.innerHTML += `<div class="${data.sender}"><strong>${data.sender}:</strong> ${data.message}</div>`;
                    messages.scrollTop = messages.scrollHeight;
                };
                
                function sendMessage() {
                    const input = document.getElementById('input');
                    if (input.value) {
                        ws.send(input.value);
                        input.value = '';
                    }
                }
                
                document.getElementById('input').addEventListener('keypress', function(e) {
                    if (e.key === 'Enter') {
                        sendMessage();
                    }
                });
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
    """
    return HTMLResponse(html)

# WebSocket endpoint for the chat
@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    
    # Create a thread for this conversation
    with Thread() as thread:
        # Send a greeting
        await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({
            "sender": "assistant",
            "message": "Hello! How can I help you today?"
        }))
        
        while True:
            try:
                # Receive message from the client
                user_message = await websocket.receive_text()

                await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({

                    "message": user_message
                }))
                
                # Get response from assistant
                response = assistant.run(user_message)
                
                # Send response to the client
                await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({
                    "sender": "assistant",
                    "message": response
                }))
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error: {e}")
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

To run this, you'd need to install FastAPI and Uvicorn:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

## Best Practices

When building conversational assistants with Marvin, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Persona Consistency**: Give your assistant clear instructions about its tone and personality.

2. **Memory Management**: Use separate memory modules for different types of information (user preferences, domain knowledge, etc.)

3. **Conversation Context**: Always use a Thread to maintain context across multiple turns.

4. **Error Handling**: Add try/except blocks around AI calls to handle potential errors gracefully.

5. **User Privacy**: Be mindful of what information you store in memory, and consider adding options for users to delete their data.

6. **Feedback Loops**: Add mechanisms for users to provide feedback on the assistant's responses.

7. **Iterative Improvement**: Monitor conversations and regularly update your assistant's instructions and knowledge.

By following these guidelines, you can create a conversational assistant that provides helpful, personalized responses while maintaining a consistent persona.
