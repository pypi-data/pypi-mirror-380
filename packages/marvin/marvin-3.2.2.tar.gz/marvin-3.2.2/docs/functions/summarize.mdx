Summarizing text is such a common operation that we created a dedicated function for it. The 
`summarize` function transforms any text into a concise summary, with optional instructions for 
format and focus.

For complex summarization needs, consider creating a custom task. The `summarize` function is a 
convenient wrapper around Marvin's task system - see [Tasks](/concepts/tasks) for more details.

## Usage

Create a simple summary:

```python
import marvin

text = """
The annual baking competition featured thirty contestants this year, each bringing their 
unique recipes and techniques. The highlight was a three-tiered chocolate cake with 
raspberry filling, which won first place. Second place went to a creative take on 
traditional apple pie, while third place was awarded to an innovative gluten-free 
cheesecake.
"""

summary = marvin.summarize(text)
print(summary)
```

```python
"A baking competition with 30 contestants saw a chocolate raspberry cake win first place, followed by an apple pie and a gluten-free cheesecake."
```

## Parameters

- `data`: The content to summarize
- `instructions`: Optional guidance for the summary
- `agent`: Optional custom agent to use
- `thread`: Optional thread for conversation context
- `context`: Optional dict of additional context

## Async Support

The function is also available in an async version:

```python
import marvin
import asyncio

async def main():
    result = await marvin.summarize_async(
        "Long text here...",
        instructions="Focus on key findings"
    )
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Examples

### Bullet Points

Get a structured summary:

```python
import marvin

text = """

and a triple-camera system. Battery life is rated at 24 hours of normal use. 
The device runs on a custom chip that enables advanced AI features.

"""

summary = marvin.summarize(
    text,
    instructions="Summarize very concisely in three bullet points (•)"
)
print(summary)
```

```python
• The smartphone has a 6.7-inch OLED screen, 5G support, and a triple-camera system.
• It offers 24 hours of battery life and runs on a custom chip for advanced AI capabilities.
• Starting price is $999 for the 128GB model.
```

### With Context

Provide background information:

```python
import marvin

text = """
Version 2.0 introduces several major changes. The API has been completely redesigned 
for better usability. Several deprecated functions have been removed, and new features 
have been added based on user feedback.
"""

summary = marvin.summarize(
    text,
    context={
        "audience": "developers",
        "document_type": "changelog"
    },
    instructions="Highlight breaking changes"
)
print(summary)
```

```python
"Breaking changes include a complete API redesign and removal of deprecated functions, with new features added."
