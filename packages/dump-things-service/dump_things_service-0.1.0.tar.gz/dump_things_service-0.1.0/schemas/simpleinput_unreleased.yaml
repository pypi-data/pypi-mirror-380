description: |
  The classes and slots in this schema have the (sole) purpose of
  informing the auto-generation of UIs for data entry. Consequently,
  the simplify and lump-together concepts and constructs that will
  eventually be represented with more appropriate data structures
  from the `base` schema.

  More information is available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
