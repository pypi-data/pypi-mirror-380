title: INM7 simplified data models for manual metadata entry
description: |
  The classes and slots in this schema have the (sole) purpose of
  informing the auto-generation of UIs for data entry. Consequently,
  the simplify and lump-together concepts and constructs that will
  eventually be represented with more appropriate data structures
  from the `base` schema.

  This schema is itself a basis for more specialized schema serving
  particular use cases. The classes defined here are foundational
  building block for INM7 concepts to be reused and extended for
  more targeted applications.

  More information is available on the schema's [about page](about).

  The schema definition is available as

  - [JSON-LD context](../unreleased.jsonld)
  - [LinkML YAML](../unreleased.yaml)
  - [OWL TTL](../unreleased.owl.ttl)
  - [SHACL TTL](../unreleased.shacl.ttl)
