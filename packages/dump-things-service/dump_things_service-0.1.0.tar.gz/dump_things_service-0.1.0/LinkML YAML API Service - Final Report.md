# LinkML YAML API Service - Final Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the development of a web API service that stores records as YAML files based on LinkML schemas. The service is implemented in Python using FastAPI and supports storing, retrieving, and searching records with pagination capabilities. The architecture is designed to scale to billions of records.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **YAML-based Storage**: Records are stored as YAML files in a sharded directory structure
- **LinkML Schema Integration**: Records are validated against the provided LinkML schema
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI-based endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Scalable Architecture**: Directory sharding based on SHA256 hashes of record PIDs

### Advanced Features
- **Pagination**: Support for both offset-based and cursor-based pagination
- **Attribute-based Search**: Search records by content of attributes
- **Sorting**: Sort results by any attribute or metadata field
- **Concurrency Handling**: Robust handling of concurrent operations

## Architecture

### Storage Strategy
The service implements a scalable storage strategy using directory sharding:

1. **SHA256-based Sharding**: 
   - The SHA256 hash of each record's PID is calculated
   - The first 3 characters are used as the subdirectory name
   - The remaining characters plus ".yaml" form the filename

2. **Indexing**:
   - SQLite database for efficient record lookup and search
   - Attributes are indexed for attribute-based queries
   - Full-text search capabilities for text attributes

3. **Concurrency Management**:
   - Transaction-based operations with proper locking
   - Retry mechanisms for handling concurrent access

## API Endpoints

### Record Management
- `POST /api/v1/records`: Create a new record
- `GET /api/v1/records/{pid}`: Get a record by PID
- `DELETE /api/v1/records/{pid}`: Delete a record by PID
- `GET /api/v1/records`: List records with pagination

### Search and Advanced Features
- `POST /api/v1/records/search`: Search for records with basic filtering
- `POST /api/v1/records/advanced-search`: Advanced search with complex filtering, sorting, and pagination options

### Schema Information
- `GET /api/v1/schema/classes`: Get all classes defined in the schema
- `GET /api/v1/schema/class/{class_name}`: Get details about a specific class

### Key Components

#### YAML Storage
The `YAMLStorage` class handles the storage and retrieval of YAML files, implementing the sharded directory structure and ensuring proper serialization/deserialization.

#### Schema Manager
The `SchemaManager` class loads and validates the LinkML schema, generating Pydantic models for validation and providing schema information to the API.

#### Enhanced Index
The `EnhancedIndexManager` class provides efficient indexing and search capabilities, with support for attribute-based filtering, sorting, and pagination.

## Current Status and Limitations

### Validated Functionality
- ✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Record validation against LinkML schema
- ✅ Scalable storage architecture
- ✅ Basic pagination

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ Advanced search functionality may require additional tuning for complex queries
- ⚠️ Full-text search is implemented but may need optimization for large datasets
- ⚠️ The current implementation uses SQLite, which may become a bottleneck for extremely large datasets

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Database Scaling**: Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for larger deployments
2. **Caching Layer**: Add Redis caching for frequently accessed records
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement background workers for indexing large batches
4. **Advanced Query Language**: Develop a more expressive query language for complex searches
5. **Monitoring and Metrics**: Add comprehensive monitoring for performance tracking

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Service
```bash
python run.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Creating a Record
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/records" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"record": {"id": "example:123", "@type": "Person", "family_name": "Doe", "given_name": "John"}}'
```

### Retrieving a Record
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/records/example:123"
```

### Searching Records
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/records/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": {"record_type": "Person"}, "page": 0, "page_size": 10}'
```

## Conclusion
The LinkML YAML API service provides a robust foundation for storing and retrieving records based on LinkML schemas. The architecture is designed to scale to billions of records through directory sharding and efficient indexing. While the core CRUD functionality is solid, some advanced search features may require additional tuning for optimal performance in production environments.
