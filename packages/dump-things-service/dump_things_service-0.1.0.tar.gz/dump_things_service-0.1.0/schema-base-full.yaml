      determined from some descriptor (e.g. a quantity, position, label/identifier).
      Technically, this declaration is done via an `AttributeSpecification` that combines
      a `predicate` with a value declaration and the attribute-related slots of a
      `Thing`. Importantly, such attributes are declared inline, because they do not
      have a unique identifier. If an identifier is available, a `Thing` declaration
      (see `relation`), and a qualification of that relationship via a `Statement`
      (see `characterized_by`) should be preferred.

      a quality, capability, disposition, function, or is an externally derived attribute
      determined from some descriptor (e.g. a quantity, position, label/identifier).
      Technically, this declaration is done via an `AttributeSpecification` that combines
      a `predicate` with a value declaration and the attribute-related slots of a
      `Thing`. Importantly, such attributes are declared inline, because they do not
      have a unique identifier. If an identifier is available, a `Thing` declaration
      (see `relation`), and a qualification of that relationship via a `Statement`
      (see `characterized_by`) should be preferred.

    comments:
    - This class does not offer common slots like "affiliation" or "email". Instead,
      this information should be expressed as `qualified_relations` to other things
      with a role characterization. An affiliation can be expressed as a relation
      to an organization, and the role that the organization has for the person (e.g.,
      "employer"). This approach has the advantage that relations like a membership
      can be expressed at either end (at an organizations potential `members` slot,
      but also (symmetrically) as a persons potential `member_of` slot).

    notes:
    - A `Distribution` is derived from `Resource`, following the logic that it is
      a materialized/specialized variant of a particular resource. It therefore should
      inherit all its slots. This is in contrast to DCAT, where `Distribution` is
      not a subclass. However, in DCAT a `Distribution` also does not have a version.
      Here we do want that, for example, to express an update of a format conversion,
      where no data change, only the layout.

      with statements on qualified relations to other things (`characterized_by`),
      or inline attributes (`attributes`). A set of `mappings` slots enables the alignment

      `Thing` instances. Such a relation is unqualified (and symmetric), and should
      be further characterized via a `Statement` (see `characterized_by`). From a
      schema perspective, the `relation` slots allows for building self-contained,
      structured documents (e.g., a JSON object) with arbitrarily complex information
