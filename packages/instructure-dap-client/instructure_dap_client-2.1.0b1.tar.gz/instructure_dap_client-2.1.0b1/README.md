# Data Access Platform CLI & Client Library

Data Access Platform (DAP) acts as a single source of data for analytics at Instructure. It provides efficient access to data collected across various educational products in bulk with high fidelity and low latency, adhering to a canonical data model.

The DAP CLI and Client Library is a Python wrapper around the [DAP Query API](https://developerdocs.instructure.com/services/dap/query-api), allowing you to fetch an initial snapshot and incremental changes, or initialize a supported database and keep it synchronized with [data in DAP](https://developerdocs.instructure.com/services/dap/dataset).

See [DAP Client Library Documentation](https://developerdocs.instructure.com/services/dap/dap-cli-readme).
