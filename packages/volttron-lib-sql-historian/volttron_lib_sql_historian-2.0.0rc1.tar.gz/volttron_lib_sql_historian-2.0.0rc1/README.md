Generic SQL Historian library that can be used to implement a historian agent with a relational database backend.
This library cannot be installed as a VOLTTRON agent as is. Only a concrete database implementation package such as
[sqlite-historian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) that depends on this library can be
installed as a VOLTTRON agent.

## Requirements

 - Python >= 3.10

## Installation

This library can be installed using ```pip install volttron-lib-sql-historian```. However, this is not necessary. Any
historian agent that uses this library will automatically install it as part of its installation. For example,
installing [SQLiteHistorian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) will automatically install
volttron-lib-sql-historian

## Development

Please see the following for contributing guidelines [contributing](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please see the following helpful guide about [developing modular VOLTTRON agents](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core/blob/develop/DEVELOPING_ON_MODULAR.md)

To create a new relational database based historian by extending this library, subclass
[DBDriver](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-lib-sql-historian/blob/develop/src/historian/sql/basedb.py#L79).
The subclass should be in a module historian.<database_type>.<database_type>functs.py for it to be dynamically loaded
by the base DBDriver. Please refer to [SQLiteHistorian](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-sqlitehistorian) as
an example
