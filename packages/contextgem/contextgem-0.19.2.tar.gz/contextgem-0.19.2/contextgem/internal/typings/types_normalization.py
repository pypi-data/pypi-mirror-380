"""
Utilities for normalizing Python type annotations into consistent forms.

Provides functions to standardize type hints across different typing notations
(e.g., converting typing.List[str] to list[str]), while ensuring compatibility
with JSON serialization requirements.

    """
    Normalizes type annotations to use consistent forms, converting
    between typing module versions and built-in generics.

    For example, typing.List[str] becomes list[str], typing.Dict[str, int]
    becomes dict[str, int], etc.

    Note: Only JSON-serializable types are supported (int, float, str, bool,
    None, list, dict). Tuples and sets are not supported as they are not
    JSON-serializable.
