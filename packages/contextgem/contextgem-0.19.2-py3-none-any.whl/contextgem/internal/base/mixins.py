"""
Module defining base mixin classes for extending functionality through class composition.

This module provides mixin classes that can be used to add specific behaviors to other classes
through multiple inheritance. Currently includes the _PostInitCollectorMixin which enables
post-initialization processing for Pydantic models.

class _PostInitCollectorMixin(BaseModel):
    """
    A mixin class that collects, holds, and executes post-initialization methods.

    This mixin uses Method Resolution Order (MRO) to gather all methods marked with
    the `__post_init__` attribute (e.g. via a decorator) from the inheritance hierarchy.
    These methods are then executed in order during the initialization process, allowing for
    customized post-initialization behavior across multiple inheritance levels.
