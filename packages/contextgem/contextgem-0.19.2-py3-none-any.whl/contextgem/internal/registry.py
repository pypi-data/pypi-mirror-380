"""
Internal registry and utilities for connecting internal logic to the
public API surface.

This module implements a registry-based mapping system where:
- Internal classes (e.g. _Aspect) contain implementation
- Public classes (e.g. Aspect) provide stable API surface
- Registry ensures consistent object creation and deserialization

Mappings are declared exclusively via the ``_expose_in_registry`` class
decorator, which:

- Always registers the decorated class against itself (``cls -> cls``)
- Optionally accepts ``additional_key`` to also map another class to the
  decorated class (``additional_key -> cls``)

These mappings enable two core operations:

- Constructing public instances from implementation types via
  ``_publicize(source_type, **data)``
- Resolving public API types by class or name during (de)serialization via
  ``_resolve_public_type``
