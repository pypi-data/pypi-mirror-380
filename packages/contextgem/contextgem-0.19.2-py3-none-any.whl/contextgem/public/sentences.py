"""
Module for handling document sentences.

This module provides the Sentence class, which represents a structured unit of text
within a document paragraph. Sentences are the fundamental building blocks of text analysis,
containing the raw text content of individual statements.

The module supports validation to ensure data integrity and integrates with the paragraph
structure to maintain the hierarchical organization of document content.

    """
    Represents a sentence within a document paragraph.

    Sentences are immutable text units that serve as the fundamental building blocks for
    document analysis. The raw text content is preserved and cannot be modified after
    initialization to maintain data integrity.

    :ivar raw_text: The complete text content of the sentence. This value is frozen after initialization.
    :vartype raw_text: str

    Note:
        Normally, you do not need to construct sentences manually, as they are populated automatically
        from document's ``raw_text`` or ``paragraphs`` attributes. Only use this constructor for
        advanced use cases, such as when you have a custom paragraph/sentence segmentation tool.

    Example:
        .. literalinclude:: ../../../dev/usage_examples/docstrings/sentences/def_sentence.py
            :language: python
            :caption: Sentence definition
