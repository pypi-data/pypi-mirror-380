"""
Module for handling example data in document processing.

This module provides classes for defining examples that can be used to guide LLM extraction tasks.
Examples serve as reference points for the model to understand the expected format and content
of extracted information. The module supports different types of examples including string-based
examples and structured JSON object examples.

Examples can be attached to concepts to provide concrete illustrations of the kind of information
to be extracted, improving the accuracy and consistency of LLM-based extraction processes.
