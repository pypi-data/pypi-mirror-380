- 🔒 **Session Management** - Multi-user support with isolated sessions
- 🌟 **Code Quality** - Zero ruff violations, 100% mypy compliance, perfect MCP
  documentation standards, comprehensive test coverage

## Getting Started

The fastest way to use DataBeak is with `uvx` (no installation required):

### For Claude Desktop

Add this to your MCP Settings file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "databeak": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/jonpspri/databeak.git",
        "databeak"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Other AI Clients

DataBeak works with Continue, Cline, Windsurf, and Zed. See the
[installation guide](https://jonpspri.github.io/databeak/installation) for
specific configuration examples.

### Docker Deployment

For production deployments or HTTP-based AI clients:

```bash
# Quick start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Access server at http://localhost:8000/mcp
# Health check at http://localhost:8000/health
```

See the [Docker deployment guide](docs/docker-deployment.md) for production
configuration, scaling, and security considerations.

### Quick Test

Once configured, ask your AI assistant:

```text
"Load a CSV file and show me basic statistics"
"Remove duplicate rows and export as Excel"
"Find outliers in the price column"
```
