                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# fev
A lightweight library that makes it easy to benchmark time series forecasting models.

- Extensible: Easy to define your own forecasting tasks and benchmarks.
- Reproducible: Ensures that the results obtained by different users are comparable.
- Easy to use: Compatible with most popular forecasting libraries.
- Minimal dependencies: Just a thin wrapper on top of 🤗[`datasets`](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index).

### How is `fev` different from other benchmarking tools?

Existing forecasting benchmarks usually fall into one of two categories:

- Standalone datasets without any supporting infrastructure. These provide no guarantees that the results obtained by different users are comparable. For example, changing the start date or duration of the forecast horizon totally changes the meaning of the scores.
- Bespoke end-to-end systems that combine models, datasets and forecasting tasks. Such packages usually come with lots of dependencies and assumptions, which makes extending or integrating these libraries into existing systems difficult.

`fev` aims for the middle ground - it provides the core benchmarking functionality without introducing unnecessary constraints or bloated dependencies. The library supports point & probabilistic forecasting, different types of covariates, as well as all popular forecasting metrics.

## 📝 Updates
- **2025-09-16**: The new version `0.6.0` contains major new functionality, [updated documentation](https://autogluon.github.io/fev/latest/), as well as some breaking changes to the `Task` API. Please check the [release notes](https://github.com/autogluon/fev/releases) for more details.

## ⚙️ Installation
```
pip install fev
```

## 🚀 Quickstart

Create a task from a dataset stored on Hugging Face Hub
```python
import fev

task = fev.Task(
    dataset_path="autogluon/chronos_datasets",
    dataset_config="m4_hourly",
    horizon=24,
)
```
Iterate over the rolling evaluation windows:
```python
for window in task.iter_windows():
    past_data, future_data = window.get_input_data()
```
- `past_data` contains the past data before the forecast horizon (item ID, past timestamps, target, all covariates).
- `future_data` contains future data that is known at prediction time (item ID, future timestamps, and known covariates)

Make predictions
```python
def naive_forecast(y: list, horizon: int) -> dict[str, list[float]]:
    # Make predictions for a single time series
    return {"predictions": [y[-1] for _ in range(horizon)]}

predictions_per_window = []
for window in task.iter_windows():
    past_data, future_data = window.get_input_data()
    predictions = [
        naive_forecast(ts[task.target_column], task.horizon) for ts in past_data
    ]
    predictions_per_window.append(predictions)
```
Get an evaluation summary
```python
task.evaluation_summary(predictions_per_window, model_name="naive")
# {'model_name': 'naive',
#  'dataset_path': 'autogluon/chronos_datasets',
#  'dataset_config': 'm4_hourly',
#  'horizon': 24,
#  'num_windows': 1,
#  'initial_cutoff': -24,
#  'window_step_size': 24,
#  'min_context_length': 1,
#  'max_context_length': None,
#  'seasonality': 1,
#  'eval_metric': 'MASE',
#  'extra_metrics': [],
#  'quantile_levels': None,
#  'id_column': 'id',
#  'timestamp_column': 'timestamp',
#  'target_column': 'target',
#  'generate_univariate_targets_from': None,
#  'past_dynamic_columns': [],
#  'excluded_columns': [],
#  'task_name': 'm4_hourly',
#  'test_error': 3.815112047601983,
#  'training_time_s': None,
#  'inference_time_s': None,
#  'dataset_fingerprint': '19e36bb78b718d8d',
#  'trained_on_this_dataset': False,
#  'fev_version': '0.6.0',
#  'MASE': 3.815112047601983}
```
The evaluation summary contains all information necessary to uniquely identify the forecasting task.

Multiple evaluation summaries produced by different models on different tasks can be aggregated into a single table.
```python
# Dataframes, dicts, JSON or CSV files supported
summaries = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autogluon/fev/refs/heads/main/benchmarks/example/results/results.csv"
fev.leaderboard(summaries)
# | model_name     |   skill_score |   win_rate | ... |
# |:---------------|--------------:|-----------:| ... |
# | auto_theta     |         0.126 |      0.667 | ... |
# | auto_arima     |         0.113 |      0.667 | ... |
# | auto_ets       |         0.049 |      0.444 | ... |
