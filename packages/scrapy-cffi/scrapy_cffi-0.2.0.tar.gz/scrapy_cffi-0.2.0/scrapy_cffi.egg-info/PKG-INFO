## scrapy_cffi

> An asyncio-style web scraping framework inspired by Scrapy, powered by `curl_cffi`.

`scrapy_cffi` is a lightweight asynchronous crawling framework that mimics the Scrapy architecture while replacing Twisted with `curl_cffi` as the underlying HTTP/WebSocket client. It is designed to be efficient, extensible, and suitable for both simple tasks and complex distributed crawlers.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Familiar Scrapy-style components: spiders, items, interceptors, pipelines
- Fully asyncio-based engine
- Built-in support for HTTP and WebSocket requests
- Lightweight signal system
- Plug-in ready interceptor and task manager design
- Redis-compatible scheduler (optional)
- Designed for high-concurrency crawling
