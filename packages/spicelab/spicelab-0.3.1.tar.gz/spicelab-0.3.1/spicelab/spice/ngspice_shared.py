"""Shared-library adapter for ngspice co-simulation.

This module exposes a thin abstraction around *libngspice* so that higher-level
code can drive transient analyses using callbacks (``on_tran_point``) and
provide external sources computed in Python (e.g. controllers or ADC models).

The default implementation deliberately defers to an injected backend because
packaging ``libngspice`` across platforms is outside the scope of the toolkit.
Production code is expected to supply a backend that actually bridges to the
shared library (e.g. via :mod:`ctypes`).  The included tests exercise this layer
with a pure-Python fake backend, demonstrating the contract that real
implementations must follow.
