- Automatic OCR processing.

  - The task of transcribing text from documents via OCR can be distributed
    among several physical or virtual computers to decrease load and increase
    availability.
  - The current language of the document is passed to the corresponding OCR
    engine to increase the text recognition rate.
  - Includes the Tesseract engine by default but the backend system allows
    interfacing with other OCR engines.
