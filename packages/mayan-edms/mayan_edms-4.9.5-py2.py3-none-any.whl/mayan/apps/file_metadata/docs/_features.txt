- Automatic extraction of file metadata.

  - In addition to the metadata defined by your organization, make use of the
    built in metadata available in many file formats.
  - Extra author information, camera settings used to take a photo, or even
    GPS coordinates.
  - Extracted file metadata can be used in other apps of the system to do
    things like automatic categorization by GPS coordinates.
