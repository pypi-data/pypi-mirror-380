This module extends the functionality of batch operations in Odoo to
support the direct creation of batches or waves from batches and to
allow you to plan Batches and Waves with a single click based on the
grouping rules defined in the operation type. It also provides smart
buttons to easily access the Waves and Batches linked to the original
Batch, improving traceability and efficiency in warehouse operations.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because in standard Odoo, waves cannot be
directly created from batches in a simple way. In warehouses where
auto-batches are already configured, users need a faster method to
generate batches or waves directly from batches without manually
grouping and creating them one by one. This module introduces a button
that allows planning Batches or Waves directly from Batches, following
the grouping rules defined in the picking type (as already established
for auto-batches).

It will be useful for you if your warehouse operations require creating
Batches or Waves from Batches in just one click, reducing manual work
and ensuring that the grouping logic respects the same fields and
constraints used by auto-batches.

Configuration
=============

1. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Settings and Activate *Batch, Wave
   & Cluster Transfers* and *Multi-Step Routes*.
2. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses, select one warehouse
   and choose deliver in 2-steps or 3-steps.
3. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Routes, select 2-step or 3-step
   route and change rules to be pull - pull (- pull).
4. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operations Types, select Pick
   Operation, select 'Planned Batches' and choose a Grouping criteria.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

Sale Flow:

1. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses, select one warehouse
   and choose deliver in 2-steps.
2. Go to Inventory > Configuration > Operation Types, choose *Pick*,
   select "Plan Origin" and select your criteria for Batch/Wave
   grouping.
3. Go to Sales > Orders > Orders, create some sale orders and confirm
   them.
4. Go to Inventory > Operations > Jobs > Batch transfers and create a
   new batch.
5. Add pickings of type delivery created from confirm the sales orders.
6. A button **Plan Batches** is displayed if the moves in the batch have
   origin moves and the origin pickings can be grouped in batches or
   origin move lines can be grouped in waves .
7. When you click on this button, the origin move lines will be batched
   according to the criteria configured in operation types.
8. If the batch has origin batch/wave, a smart button is displayed.
