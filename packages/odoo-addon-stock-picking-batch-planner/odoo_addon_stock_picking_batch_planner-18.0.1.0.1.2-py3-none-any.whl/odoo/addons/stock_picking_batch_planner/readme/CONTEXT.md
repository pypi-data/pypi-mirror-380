This module was developed because in standard Odoo, waves cannot be directly created
from batches in a simple way. In warehouses where auto-batches are already configured,
users need a faster method to generate batches or waves directly from batches without manually
grouping and creating them one by one. This module introduces a button that allows
planning Batches or Waves directly from Batches, following the grouping rules defined in the
picking type (as already established for auto-batches).

It will be useful for you if your warehouse operations require creating Batches or Waves from
Batches in just one click, reducing manual work and ensuring that the grouping logic
respects the same fields and constraints used by auto-batches.
