    # in the master process, and os.fork's behavior is to copy the state of
    # parent to the child process, we destroy the executor in the parent
    # process before the forking, so that the workers initialize new
    # executor(s) and therefore avoid working with the wrong internal executor
    # state (i.e. number of workers idle in the pool). A long therm solution
    # would be to use os.spawn instead of os.fork for the workers.
