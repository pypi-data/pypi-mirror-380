    This release adds a new config option require_secure to the spice
    configuration group. Defaulting to false to match the previous
    behavior, if set to true the SPICE consoles will require TLS
    protected connections. Unencrypted connections will be gracefully
    redirected to the TLS port via the SPICE protocol.

    This release adds a new console type, ``spice-direct`` which provides
    the connection information required to talk the native SPICE
    protocol directly to qemu on the hypervisor. This is intended to
    be fronted by a proxy which will handle authentication separately.
    This new console type is exposed in the Compute API v2.99
    microversion. To facilitate this proxying, a new config option
    ``spice_direct_proxy_base_url`` is added to the spice configuration group.
    This option is used to construct a URL containing an access token for
    the console, and that access token can be turned into hypervisor
    connection information using the pre-existing
    os-console-auth-tokens API.
