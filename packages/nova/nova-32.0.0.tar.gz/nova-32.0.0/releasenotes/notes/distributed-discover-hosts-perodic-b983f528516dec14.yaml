    The nova scheduler now supports enabling the nova cell discover hosts
    perodic task on multiple schedulers. In prior release enabling this
    feature required setting the discover_hosts_in_cells_interval option
    to a value greater than 0 in at most one scheduler, with the 2025.1
    release it was possible to enable the feature on multiple schedulers
    via the introduction of leader election. This simplifies deployment
    of nova in kubernetes by allowing the operator to deploy
    multiple schedulers and have them elect a single leader that will run
    the discover hosts perodic task.
