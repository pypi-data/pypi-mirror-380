    The 2.98 microversion has been added. This microversion adds support for
    including image properties as new ``properties`` subkey under the struct at
    the existing ``image`` key in the response for ``GET /servers/{server_id}``
    (server show), ``PUT /servers/{server_id}``
    (server update), and ``GET /servers/detail`` (list server --long) APIs.
    Also the same is included in rebuild case of
    ``POST /server/{server_id}/action`` (server rebuild) API response.
