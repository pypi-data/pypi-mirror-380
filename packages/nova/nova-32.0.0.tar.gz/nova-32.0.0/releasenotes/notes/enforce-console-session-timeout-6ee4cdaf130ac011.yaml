    This is a security-enhancing feature that automatically closes console sessions
    exceeding a defined timeout period. To enable this functionality, operators are
    required to set the 'enforce_session_timeout' boolean configuration option to True.

    The enforcement is implemented via a timer mechanism, initiating when users access
    the console and concluding upon the expiration of the set console token.

    This ensures the graceful closure of console sessions on the server side, aligning
    with security best practices.
