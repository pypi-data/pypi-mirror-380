    The remote debugger has been removed from the codebase. If you were using
    it, you will need to find an alternative solution. The remote debugger was
    un-maintained and was first introduced in the early days of OpenStack when
    we used python 2.7. While it was useful at the time, it has not been
    maintained and updated to work with new versions of python and eventlet.
    As a result it is being removed until we complete the eventlet removal.
