    The ``hw:sound_model`` flavor extra spec and the matching
    ``hw_sound_model`` image property were added to allow the
    configuration of a sound device within an instance. This is useful
    with the new spice-direct console type. The default remains no sound
    device, but when using the libvirt hypervisor driver you can select
    from ``sb16``, ``es1370``, ``pcspk``, ``ac97``, ``ich6``, ``ich9``,
    ``usb``, and ``virtio``. For most use-cases ``usb`` is likely to be
    the best choice unless you have at least libvirt 8.2.0 and libvirt
    10.4.0.
