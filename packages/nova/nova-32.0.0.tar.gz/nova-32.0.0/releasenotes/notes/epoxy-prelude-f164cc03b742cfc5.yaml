    The OpenStack 2025.1 Epoxy (Nova 31.0.0) release includes many new features
    and bug fixes. Please be sure to read the upgrade section which describes
    the required actions to upgrade your cloud from 30.0.0 (2024.2) to 31.0.0
    (2025.1).
    As a reminder, OpenStack 2025.1 is a `Skip-Level-Upgrade Release`__
    (starting from now, we name it a `SLURP release`) meaning that you can
    do rolling-upgrades from 2024.1 Caracal directly by skipping to upgrade to
    2024.2 Dalmatian release.

    There are a few major changes worth mentioning. This is not an exhaustive
    list:

    - The latest Compute API microversion supported for 2024.2 is `v2.100`__.

    - New kernel vfio-PCI variant drivers like nvidia GRID on Ubuntu 24.04 are
      now supported by our PCI passthrough feature. You can create instances
      using those specific PCI devices but also live migrate them.

    - Manila shares can now be directly attached to instances by a new Nova
      shares API.

    - A new ImagePropertiesWeigher is able to spread or pack instances using the
      same image properties.

    - The nova-scheduler service now does leader election in an attempt to have
      only one run host discovery periodically (if configured) instead of all
      of them running it all the time in parallel.

    - Image properties and scheduler hints are now returned as part of the
      instance show API response.

    - Nova added support for the IGB VIF model.

    - Unified limits are no longer experimental since we added a nova-manage tool
      for migrating existing quota limits to Keystone automatically and given
      we added new configuration options for telling which resource classes
      are either required or ignored.

    - Nova now supports a new console type called `spice-direct`Â  if you define
      a specific SPICE protocol native proxy URL (eg. a kerbside URL). Direct
      SPICE VDI consoles enable a much richer virtual desktop experience.
