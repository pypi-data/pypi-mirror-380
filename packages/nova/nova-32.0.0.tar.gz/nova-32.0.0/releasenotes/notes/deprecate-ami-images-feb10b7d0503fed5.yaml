deprecations:
  - |
    AMI, AKI, and ARI image formats are now deprecated in Nova. The special-
    case handling for them will be removed in a future release, and Nova will
    stop being able to boot from them at that time. The kernel-id and
    ramdisk-id linkages will continue to be honored from base images and are
    unaffecfted by this deprecation.
