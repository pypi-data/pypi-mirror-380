    The ``HyperV`` virt driver has been removed. It was deprecated in the
    Nova 27.2.0 (Antelope) release. This driver was untested and has no
    maintainers. In addition, it has a dependency on the OpenStack Winstacker
    project that also has been retired.

    The RDP console was only available for the HyperV driver, therefore the
    RDP console related APIs below will return HTTP ``400 (BadRequest)`` error:

    * GET RDP console:

      * Server Action Get RDP Console:
        POST /servers/{server_id}/action (os-getRDPConsole Action)

      * RDP protocol support from remote console API:
        POST /servers/{server_id}/remote-consoles

    * GET RDP console connection information:

      * Show Console Connection Information:
        GET /os-console-auth-tokens/{console_token}

    The following config options which only apply for the ``HyperV`` virt
    driver or RDP console APIs also have been removed:

    * ``[hyperv] dynamic_memory_ratio``
    * ``[hyperv] enable_instance_metrics_collection``
    * ``[hyperv] instances_path_share``
    * ``[hyperv] limit_cpu_features``
    * ``[hyperv] mounted_disk_query_retry_count``
    * ``[hyperv] mounted_disk_query_retry_interval``
    * ``[hyperv] power_state_check_timeframe``
    * ``[hyperv] power_state_event_polling_interval``
    * ``[hyperv] qemu_img_cmd``
    * ``[hyperv] vswitch_name``
    * ``[hyperv] wait_soft_reboot_seconds``
    * ``[hyperv] config_drive_cdrom``
    * ``[hyperv] config_drive_inject_password``
    * ``[hyperv] volume_attach_retry_count``
    * ``[hyperv] volume_attach_retry_interval``
    * ``[hyperv] enable_remotefx``
    * ``[hyperv] use_multipath_io``
    * ``[hyperv] iscsi_initiator_list``
    * ``[rdp] enabled``
    * ``[rdp] html5_proxy_base_url``

    The following extra specs which only apply for the ``HyperV`` virt
    driver have been removed.

    * ``os:monitors``
