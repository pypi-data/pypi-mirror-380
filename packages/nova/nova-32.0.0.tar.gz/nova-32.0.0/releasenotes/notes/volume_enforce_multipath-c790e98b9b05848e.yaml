    The new ``[libvirt] volume_enforce_multipath`` option has been added. When
    this option is set to ``True``, attachment of volumes is aborted when
    multipathd is not running in the host. Otherwise it falls back to single
    path. This option also makes the libvirt driver to check multipathd during
    initialization, and the compute service fails to start if mulitipathd is
    not running.
