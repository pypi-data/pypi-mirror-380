    The ``hw:usb_model`` flavor extra spec and the matching ``hw_usb_model``
    image property were added to allow the configuration of a USB controller
    within an instance. This is useful with the new spice-direct console
    type which supports passing through USB devices from the client to the
    instance, such as a smart card reader. There is also an additional
    ``hw:redirected_usb_ports`` / ``hw_redirected_usb_ports`` pair which
    controls how many ports the USB controller has. This number will
    vary based on the USB controller selected. The default remains no
    USB controller, but when using the libvirt hypervisor driver you can
    now also select from ``qemu_xhci`` and ``nec_xhci``.
