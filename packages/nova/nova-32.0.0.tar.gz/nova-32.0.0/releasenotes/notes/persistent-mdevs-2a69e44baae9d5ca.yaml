    With the libvirt driver and libvirt version 7.3.0 or newer, mediated
    devices for vGPUs are now persisted across reboots of a compute host.

    .. note::

       After a compute host reboots, if you have a GPU that supports SR-IOV,
       then the virtual functions for the GPU must be enabled again before
       instances will be able to use their vGPUs.
       Please see https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/admin/virtual-gpu.html
       for more information.
