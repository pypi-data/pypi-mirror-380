    The libvirt driver now automatically enables ``autodeflate`` and
    ``freePageReporting`` features for virtio memory balloon devices.
    The ``autodeflate`` feature allows the QEMU virtio memory balloon
    to release memory at the last moment before a guest process is
    killed by the Out of Memory killer. The ``freePageReporting``
    feature enables the memory balloon to return unused pages back
    to the hypervisor for use by other guests or processes, improving
    overall memory efficiency on the compute host.
