    A new `ImagePropertiesWeigher` has been added. It will compare the number
    of image properties of the image being booted for each of the host with how
    many existing instances use them. By default this weigher is enabled but
    with a value of 0.0 for
    `[filter_scheduler]/image_props_weight_multiplier` which
    won't modify the existing scheduling behavior.
    If you want to pack instances having the same image properties on the same
    hosts, modify `image_props_weight_multiplier`Â to a positive value. If you
    want to spread instances with the same properties around all hosts, then
    please modify `image_props_weight_multiplier` to a negative value.
    Another configuration option
    `[filter_scheduler]/image_props_weight_setting` allows you to define
    fine-grained weights for each of the properties you actually would like to
    weigh (eg. `os_distro`). Please refer to the documentation for more details
    about how to use this configuration option.
