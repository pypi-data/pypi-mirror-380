    The libvirt driver can now support requests for guest RAM to be encrypted
    using the AMD SEV-ES(Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State),
    instead of AMD SEV.

    Usage of AMD SEV-ES for memory encryption can be required either via
    a flavor which has the ``hw:mem_encryption_model`` extra spec set to
    ``amd-sev-es``, or via an image which has the ``hw_mem_encryption_model``
    property set to ``amd-sev-es``. In case the extra spec and the property are
    unset or set to ``amd-sev``, then AMD SEV is used for memory encryption.
