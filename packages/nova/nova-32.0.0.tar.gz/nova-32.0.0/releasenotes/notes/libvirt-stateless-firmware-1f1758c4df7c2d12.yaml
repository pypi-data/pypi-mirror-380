    Libvirt virt driver now supports launching instances with stateless
    firmware. The new ``hw_firmware_stateless`` image property can be used to
    enable this feature. Note that the feature can be used only for
    the instances with UEFI firmware. This feature requires libvirt v8.6.0 or
    later.
