    Instances using vGPUs can now be correctly live-migrated by the libvirt
    driver between compute nodes supporting the same mediated device types used
    by the instance. In order to be able to do this, the compute hosts need to
    support at least the minimum versions of libvirt-8.6.0, QEMU-8.1.0 and
    Linux kernel 5.18.0. If operators use multiple vGPU types per compute, they
    need to make sure they already use custom traits or custom resource classes
    for the GPUs resource providers and that the instance was created with a
    flavor using either a custom resource class or asking for a custom trait in
    order to make sure that Placement API will provide the right target GPU
    using the same mdev type for the instance.
