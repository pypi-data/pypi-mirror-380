deprecations:
  - |
    The legacy v2 API is now deprecated for removal, and the status in the root
    version document (``/``) has been changed from ``SUPPORTED`` to
    ``DEPRECATED``. This will cause some clients like keystoneauth to ignore
    the endpoint by default. Users are encouraged to switch the v2.1 API, which
    is functionally identical to the v2 API when using the ``2.1`` API
    microversion.
