    When an instance booted from local storage is unshelved,
    the image ID published to the libvirt domain metadata was
    the ID for the temporary Glance image generated to store
    the instance state, instead of the original image as intended.
    Since the temporary image is removed after the instance is
    unshelved, this results in an invalid image ID being stored
    in the libvirt domain metadata. This issue has now been fixed.
    Affected instances will need to be shutdown, restarted, cold
    migrated or shelved-and-unshelved to update the metadata.
