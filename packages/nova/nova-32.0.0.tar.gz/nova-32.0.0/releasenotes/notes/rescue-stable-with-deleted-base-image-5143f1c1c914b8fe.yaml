    `Bug #2002606`_: Previously, server rescue in stable device mode had a
    dependency on the original image used to create or rebuild the server.
    If the original image was deleted from Glance, the server could not be
    rescued. The issue has been fixed by falling back to the instance image
    metadata if the original image is not found in Glance.
