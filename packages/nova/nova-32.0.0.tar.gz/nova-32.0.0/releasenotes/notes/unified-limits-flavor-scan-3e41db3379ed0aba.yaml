    The ``nova-manage limits migrate_to_unified_limits`` command will now scan
    the API and cell databases to detect resource classes that do not have
    registered limits set in Keystone and report them to the console.

    The purpose of the flavor scan is to assist operators who are migrating
    from legacy quotas to unified limits quotas. The current behavior with
    unified limits is to fail quota checks if resources requested are missing
    registered limits in Keystone. With flavor scanning in
    ``migrate_to_unified_limits``, operators can easily determine what resource
    classes for which they need to create registered limits.
