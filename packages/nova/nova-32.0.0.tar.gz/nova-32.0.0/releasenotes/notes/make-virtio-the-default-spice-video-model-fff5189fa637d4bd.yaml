    Ubuntu 24.04 does not support the QXL video model or spice.
    Operators using instances with this video model will be unable to start
    them if moving to Ubuntu 24.04. CentOS 9 and RHEL 9 previously compiled
    out support for spice, and as QXL was implemented in libspice, support
    for QXL was removed as a result for the removal of support for spice.
    The QXL model was a spice optimized video model and is no longer
    supported by several distros. To avoid issues with starting instances,
    operators should change the spice video model from QXL to virtio and
    replace the spice console with vnc. For existing instances the video
    model can be updated with the ``nova-manage image_property set`` command.
    When updating the embedded image properties, operators should evaluate if
    any glance images request the QXL video model and update them or work
    with the image owner to have them move to a modern video model.

    When the default video model for libvirt was updated to virtio in Yoga
    the default for hosts using spice was not changed. This lead to issues
    when starting instances on hosts that had spice configured with QXL as
    the default video model on modern distros. To address this, the default
    spice video model is now virtio.
