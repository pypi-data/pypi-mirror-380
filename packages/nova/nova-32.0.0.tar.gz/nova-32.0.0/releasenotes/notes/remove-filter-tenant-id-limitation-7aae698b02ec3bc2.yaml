    This release removes the limit of the number of tenants that can
    be specified for an aggregate and honored by the
    `AggregateMultitenancyIsolation` filter. It now respects multiple
    keys prefixed by `filter_tenant_id` like the request filter
    implementation.  You can use `filter_tenant_id` as a prefix to set
    an infinite number of properties for tenant IDs on the aggregate.
    This change has been implemented in a manner that preserves
    backward compatibility. Existing configurations using
    `filter_tenant_id` will continue to function as expected.
