deprecations:
  - |
    The ``[libvirt] num_memory_encrypted_guests`` option has been deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release. The option will be completely
    replaced by the number of SEV-encrypted guests presented by domain
    capabilities API in libvirt, which is available since version 8.0.0 .
    The libvirt's API is more feature complete and supports detecting the limit
    for SEV-ES-encrypted guests.
