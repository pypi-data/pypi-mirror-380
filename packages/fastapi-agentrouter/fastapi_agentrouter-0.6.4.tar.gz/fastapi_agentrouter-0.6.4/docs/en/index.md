# FastAPI AgentRouter

Simplified AI Agent integration for FastAPI with multi-platform support.

## Overview

FastAPI AgentRouter makes it incredibly easy to integrate AI agents into your FastAPI applications. With just 2 lines of code, you can expose your agent through multiple platforms including Slack, Discord, and webhooks.

## Key Features

- ðŸš€ **Simple Integration** - Just 1 line to add agent to your FastAPI app
- ðŸ¤– **Vertex AI ADK Support** - Native support for Google's Agent Development Kit
- ðŸ”Œ **Multi-Platform** - Built-in Slack, Discord, and webhook endpoints
- ðŸŽ¯ **Protocol-Based** - Works with any agent implementing `stream_query` method
- âš¡ **Async & Streaming** - Full async support with streaming responses
- ðŸ”’ **Graceful Disabling** - Disabled endpoints return HTTP 404 Not Found

## Quick Example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_agentrouter import create_agent_router

def get_agent():
    # Return your agent (e.g., Vertex AI AdkApp)
    return your_agent

app = FastAPI()

# That's it! Just one line
app.include_router(create_agent_router(get_agent))
```

Your agent is now available at:
- `/agent/webhook` - Generic webhook endpoint
- `/agent/slack/events` - Slack events and slash commands
- `/agent/discord/interactions` - Discord interactions

## Why FastAPI AgentRouter?
