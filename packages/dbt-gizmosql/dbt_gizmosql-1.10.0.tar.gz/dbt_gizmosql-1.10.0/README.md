**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

dbt is the T in ELT. Organize, cleanse, denormalize, filter, rename, and pre-aggregate the raw data in your warehouse so that it's ready for analysis.

## GizmoSQL
This repo contains the base code to help you start to build out your dbt-gizmosql adapter plugin, for more information on how to build out the adapter please follow the [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/contributing/building-a-new-adapter)

### Installation

#### Option 1 - from PyPi
```shell
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip

python -m pip install dbt-core dbt-gizmosql
```

#### Option 2 - from source - for development of the adapter
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gizmodata/dbt-gizmosql

cd dbt-gizmosql

# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install the dbt GizmoSQL adapter - in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install --editable .[dev]
```

### Usage of the dbt GizmoSQL adapter

#### Option 1: dbt init
You can setup the adapter by running `dbt init` - and choosing values that the wizard prompts you for.   

Then you can run by going into the directory for the project you just created:
```bash
dbt run
```

#### Option 2: Setup dbt.profiles.yml
Add something like the following to your `~/.dbt.profiles.yml` file (change the values to match your environment):
```yaml
my-gizmosql-db:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: gizmosql
      host: localhost
      port: 31337
      user: [username]
      password: [password]
      use_encryption: True
      tls_skip_verify: True
      threads: 2
```

** Note **
### Adapter Scaffold default Versioning
This adapter plugin follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The first version of this plugin is v1.10.0, in order to be compatible with dbt Core v1.10.0.

It's also brand new! For GizmoSQL-specific functionality, we will aim for backwards-compatibility wherever possible. We are likely to be iterating more quickly than most major-version-1 software projects. To that end, backwards-incompatible changes will be clearly communicated and limited to minor versions (once every three months).
