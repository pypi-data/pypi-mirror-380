    [`bug 1688137 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1688137>`_]
    Fixed the AccountLocked exception being shown to the end user since
    it provides some information that could be exploited by a
    malicious user. The end user will now see Unauthorized instead of
    AccountLocked, preventing user info oracle exploitation.
