    [`bug 2045974 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2045974>`_]
    The Domain Manager Persona has been added. This makes identity-related
    self-service capabilities for users within domains possible without
    requiring the 'admin' role. Assigning the 'manager' role to users in domain
    scope now allows them to manage projects, groups, users and role
    assignments within the domain. This is subject to the following
    restriction: the roles that domain managers can assign and revoke are
    limited by a new ``domain_managed_target_role`` policy rule which defaults
    to 'reader', 'member' and 'manager'.
