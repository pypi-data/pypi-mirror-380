upgrade:
  - |
    The WSGI scripts, ``keystone-wsgi-admin`` and ``keystone-wsgi-public``,
    have been removed. Deployment tooling should instead reference the Python
    module paths for the service, ``keystone.wsgi.api``, if their chosen WSGI
    server supports this (gunicorn, uWSGI) or implement a ``.wsgi`` script
    themselves if not (mod_wsgi).
