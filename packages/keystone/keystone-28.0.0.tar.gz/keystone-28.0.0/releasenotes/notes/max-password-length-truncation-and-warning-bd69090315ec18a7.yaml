    Passwords will now be automatically truncated if the max_password_length is
    greater than the allowed length for the selected password hashing
    algorithm. Currently only bcrypt has fixed allowed lengths defined which is
    54 characters. A warning will be generated in the log if a password is
    truncated.  This will not affect existing passwords, however only the first
    54 characters of existing bcrypt passwords will be validated.
