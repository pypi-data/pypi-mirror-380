    Dependency on abandoned library `passlib` has been dropped in favor of
    using `bcrypt` and `cryptography` directly. It was ensured that passwords
    hashed with `passlib` are still supported, but absence of cornercases can
    not be guaranteed. If users are not able to login using old password such
    password must be rotated.
