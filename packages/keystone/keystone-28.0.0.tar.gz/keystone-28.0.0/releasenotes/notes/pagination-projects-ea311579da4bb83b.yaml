    New configuration variable `max_db_limit` is added to set an absolute limit
    amount of entries fetched from the database at a single time. It is used in
    resource pagination. Existing option `list_limit` is optional and describes
    preferred count of entries while `max_db_limit` sets top limit applied to
    user input and individual `list_limit` options.

    Project and domain listing supports pagination. Query parameters `limit`
    and `marker` are added and work as described in `API-SIG doc
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-sig/guidelines/pagination_filter_sort.html>`_
