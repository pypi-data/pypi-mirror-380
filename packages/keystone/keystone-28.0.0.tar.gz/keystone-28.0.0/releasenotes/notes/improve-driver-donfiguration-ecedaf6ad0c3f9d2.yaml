    Improve configuration management for the out-of-tree identity drivers. When
    driver implements a special method it is being invoked before instantiating
    the driver when reading configuration from the database. Also 2 new
    `domain_config` section configuration options are added to allow such
    driver specific parameters to be managed using the API.
