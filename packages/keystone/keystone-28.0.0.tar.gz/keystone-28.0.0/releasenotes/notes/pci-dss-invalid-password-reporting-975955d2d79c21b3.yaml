    `bug 2060972 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2060972>`_
    Added new configuration option ``[security_compliance]
    report_invalid_password_hash`` to enable and configure reporting of hashes
    of submitted invalid passwords, which could be used to facilitate analysis
    of failed login attempts (as per PCI DSS requirements). The corresponding
    Keystone specification - `Include invalid password details in audit
    messages <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/specs/keystone/2025.1/pci-dss-invalid-password-reporting.html>`_.
