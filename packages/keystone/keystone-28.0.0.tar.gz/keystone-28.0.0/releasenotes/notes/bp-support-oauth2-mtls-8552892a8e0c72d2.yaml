    [`blueprint support-oauth2-mtls <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/support-oauth2-mtls>`_]
    Provide the option for users to proof-of-possession of OAuth 2.0 access
    token based on `RFC8705 OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication and
    Certificate-Bound Access Tokens`. Users can now use the OAuth 2.0 Access
    Token API to get an OAuth 2.0 certificate-bound access token from the
    keystone identity server with OAuth 2.0 credentials and Mutual-TLS
    certificates. Then users can use the OAuth 2.0 certificate-bound access
    token and the Mutual-TLS certificates to access the OpenStack APIs that use
    the keystone middleware to support OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS client
    authentication.
