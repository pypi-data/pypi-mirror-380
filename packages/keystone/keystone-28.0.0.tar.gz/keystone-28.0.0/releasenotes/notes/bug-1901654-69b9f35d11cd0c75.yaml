    [`bug 1901654 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1901654>`_]
    Previously, generate_public_ID() in sha256.py assumed the passed arguments is str data type.
    However, python-ldap 3.0 or later returns bytes data type for attribute values except fields
    of distinguished names, relative distinguished names, attribute names, queries.
    If keystone running on Python3 is integrated with LDAP and the LDAP server has local_id variable
    in its attribute, user login operations will fail due to the assumption and modifiation of python-ldap.
    By this fix, generate_public_ID() properly handles bytes data type in the parameter.
