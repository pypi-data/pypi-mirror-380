    Users can now use the OAuth2.0 Access Token API to get an access token
    from the keystone identity server with application credentials. Then the
    users can use the access token to access the OpenStack APIs that use the
    keystone middleware to support OAuth2.0 client credentials authentication
    through the keystone identity server.
