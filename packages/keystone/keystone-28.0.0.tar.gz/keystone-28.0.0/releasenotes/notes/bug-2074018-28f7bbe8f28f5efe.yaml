    Added a new command to the admin cli tool:
    `keystone-manage reset_last_active`.  This new command updates the database
    to overwritet any NULL values in `last_active_at` in the user table to the
    current time. This is a necessary step to fix Bug #2074018. See launchpad
    for details.

    Fixed Bug #2074018: Changed the user model to always save the date of the
    last user activity in `last_active_at`.  Previous to this change, the
    `last_active_at` field was only updated when the option for
    `[security_compliance] disable_user_account_days_inactive` was set.
    If your deployment is affected by this bug, you must run
    `keystone-manage reset_last_active` before setting the
    `disable_user_account_days_inactive` option.

    The new `keystone-manage rest_last_active` command resets all NULL values
    in `last_active_at` in the user table to help fix Bug #2074018.  Running
    this command may be necessary in environments that have been deployed for
    a long time and later decide to adopt the
    `[security_compliance disable_user_account_days_inactive = X` option.
    See Bug #2074018 for details.

    A side-effect of this command is that it resets the amount of time that an
    unused account is active for.  Unused accounts will remain active until the
    configured days have elapsed since the day the command is run.
