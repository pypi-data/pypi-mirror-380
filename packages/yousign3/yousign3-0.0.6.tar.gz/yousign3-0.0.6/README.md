# Yousign3

Yousign3, **aim** to be a safe and complete YouSign Python Client.

Dependencies:
- Why Pydantic?
- - Make Dataclass serializable
- - Give a Strict-typed environment.

## What Yousign3 can do:

Currently, I focus to make **Electronic Signature** functionalities usable with less efforts.
