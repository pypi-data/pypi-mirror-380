## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Update to QT6 / PySide6.

## [0.5.0] 2025-06-25

### Fixed

- Fixed some typos, improve coding style

- Fixed MSVC runtime issue that lead to a crash in the standalone and packaged version on Windows.
  PyQt5 embed its own version of Qt (via `PyQt5-qt5`) which bundle a MSVC runtime incompatible with
  `pgeof` and `dendroptimized` when they are compiled with an aggressive set of optimizations.
  CC plugin was not affected, because in this specific context PyQT5 load the MSVC RT and Qt5 libs
  included into CC.

### Added

- Include the 3DFin version number in "automatic" Github issue reporting.

- Now depends on `dendromatics` with `dendroptimized` support for massive runtime improvements.
  A New version of `CSF-3DFin` and an approximate parallel method for computing distances to axes
  should also offer runtime improvements.

- Added `uv` support for installation. see `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## [0.4.1] 2024-06-28

### Added

- This changelog file!
- Support of macOS (see `Changed` section)
- Handling of out of memory errors.

### Changed

- Now depends on `dendromatics` 0.5.0 which notably now use `pgeof` instead of `jakteristics` for feature computation.
  3Fin should be faster and is compatible with macOS out of the box.

### Fixed

- Add a fix for multiprocessing in a frozen context (standalone).
