SimpleVFX: A simple way to spawn image-based visual effects in PyGame.

This repo contains 2 files: SimpleVFX.py, the file with the actual code, and SimpleVFXExample.py, an example showing how you can use it

All classes and functions in the main file are thoroughly commented, but please open an Issue if anything is unclear.

Feel free to use this as you like, without credit or charge, if it's helpful. Or to rage at me if it's not. If you do use it, I would love to see how!

Thanks,
