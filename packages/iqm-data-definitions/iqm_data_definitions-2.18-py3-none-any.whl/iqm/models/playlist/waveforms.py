@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Waveform:
    r"""Describes the normalized shape of a real-valued control pulse.

    The shape is described by a function :math:`f: \mathbb{R} \to [-1, 1]` that comes with an implicit
    sampling window. :math:`f` maps time (measured in units of the sampling window duration and relative
    to its center point) to the value of the pulse at that time.

    Each Waveform subclass may have attributes that affect its shape. All time-like attributes are
    measured in units of the sampling window duration. The station method ``non_timelike_attributes``
    may be used to define non-timelike attributes and their units (in addition to `"s"`, `"Hz"` has a special
    behaviour in that such attributes will be converted to the units of the inverse of duration). Providing type
    hints to the waveform attributes is mandatory, as they are used in parsing the information for the
    ``GateImplementations``. Supported scalar attribute types are: ``int``, ``float``, ``complex``, ``str``, ``bool``.
    In addition, ``list[<scalar type>]`` is supported for all the aforementioned scalar types, and also
    ``numpy.ndarray``, in which case it is interpreted to contain complex numbers.

    When the Waveform is used by an instrument it is typically sampled using the :meth:`sample` method, which
    converts it into an array of :attr:`n_samples` equidistant samples, generated using the midpoint method,
    by evaluating the function :math:`f(t)` inside the sampling window :math:`t \in [-1/2, 1/2]`.
    The instruments will discretize the values of the samples to a finite, instrument-dependent resolution,
    typically 14--16 bits.

    Usually, it is sufficient for Waveforms to describe normalized waveforms (i.e. using the full
    value range :math:`[-1, 1]`), not including a scaling prefactor in the defining expression.
    Instead, the scaling should be specified as a parameter of the :class:`.Instruction` using the Waveform
    (e.g. :class:`.IQPulse`, :class:`.RealPulse`), thus allowing compilers to more efficiently
    re-use waveforms and utilize the available hardware support to perform such re-scaling in real time.

        Used to construct the parameters for the calibration data required by the waveform.
        By default all the waveform attributes are "timelike" (the unit for their calibration data is s).
        However, some waveform attributes can be dimensionless, e.g. the relative amplitudes in a sum of
        consisting of multiple terms, or frequency-like (calibration data has the unit 'Hz').
        If a Waveform subclass has non-timelike attributes, it needs to redefine this method.

        When the Waveform is constructed, all timelike calibration data is converted to units of the
        sampling window duration, and all frequency-like calibration data into units of inverse sampling
        window duration.
