## Introduction

This library provides a simple visual countdown widget, designed to subtly
let the user know that a period of time is passing; essentially a simple
"wait some time" progress bar.

Uses could be as a non-intrusive countdown in some sort of quiz application,
or a cool-down display in an application that's waiting to hit a busy API
endpoint again.

## Installing

The package can be installed with `pip` or related tools, for example:

```sh
$ pip install textual-countdown
```

## Demo

Once installed, you can try a demo of the library with:

```sh
$ python -m textual_countdown
```

Please see [the main documentation for the
library](https://textual-countdown.davep.dev/) for details on how to use it.

## TODO

See [the TODO tag in
issues](https://github.com/davep/textual-countdown/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ATODO)
to see what I'm planning.
