Fallback handler
Sanic comes with three fallback exception handlers:
HTML
Text
JSON
These handlers present differing levels of detail depending upon whether your application is in debug mode or not.
By default, Sanic will be in "auto" mode, which means that it will using the incoming request and potential matching handler to choose the appropriate response format. For example, when in a browser it should always provide an HTML error page. When using curl, you might see JSON or plain text.
