## Parameters of `play` function

| Parameter     | Type            | Default | Description                                      |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `speed`       | int             | 5       | Controls the game speed (higher = faster).       |
| `food_emoji`  | str             | "🍎"   | Emoji to represent the food on the grid.         |
| `grid_size`   | tuple (int,int) | (15,12) | Size of the game grid as (width, height).        |
| `block_emoji` | str             | "🟫"   | Emoji or character to represent the grid blocks. |

---

## Controls

* **Arrow keys** to move the snake:

  * Up arrow: Move up
  * Down arrow: Move down
  * Left arrow: Move left
  * Right arrow: Move right
* **Space bar** to pause or resume the game.

---

## How to Play

* The snake moves continuously on the grid.
* Eat the food (represented by the food emoji) to grow longer and increase your score.
* Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
* The game ends if you collide with yourself or the grid edges.
* Your current score is displayed above the grid.

---

## Notes

* The game uses ANSI escape codes for terminal control (clear screen, colors).
* Works best on terminals supporting Unicode and ANSI colors.
* Keyboard input requires the `pynput` package (automatically handled if installed via pip).
* If running the game script directly, make sure `pynput` is installed: `pip install pynput`.

---



## Troubleshooting

* If the game does not respond to key presses, ensure your terminal supports `pynput` keyboard listening.
* On Windows, you may need to run the terminal with administrator privileges for keyboard capture.
* If `pynput` is not installed, install it via `pip install pynput`.
