    Added configuration option ``delete_vrf_on_disconnect`` which prevents
    deletion of VRF from FRR and Linux kernel networking. This allows to
    establish a peering session within VRF as well as externally enslave
    additional interfaces into VRF in case EVPN integration with the rest of
    infrastructure is not preferable.
