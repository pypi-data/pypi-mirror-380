    This patch introduces a new driver that instead of connecting to the OVN
    SB DB to watch for relevant events, it connects to the OVN NB DB. The main
    reasons for doing so are: 1) scalability purposes; and 2) rely on the
    stable fields offered by the NB DB, instead of the SB DB that may change
    any time and break our watchers logic (as it has already happened with the
    OVN Load_Balancer table and its datapath field usage).
