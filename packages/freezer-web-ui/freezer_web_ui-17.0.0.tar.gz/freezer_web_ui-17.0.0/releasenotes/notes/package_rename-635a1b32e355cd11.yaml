    Python package name for Freezer Horizon Dashboard has been renamed from
    ``disaster_recovery`` to ``freezer_ui`` in order to align with repository
    naming and naming conventions for Dashboards.
    This will not have any effect on URIs inside of the Horizon as well as
    representation of the Dashboard in UI.
