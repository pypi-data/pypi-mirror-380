VOLTTRON historian agent that stores data into a SQLite database


## Requirements

 - Python >= 3.10

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

   ```shell
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

2. Installing volttron-sqlite-historian requires a running volttron instance.

    ```shell
    pip install volttron
    
    # Start platform with output going to volttron.log
    volttron -vv -l volttron.log &
    ```

3. Create a agent configuration file 
   SQLite historian supports two parameters
    
    - connection -  This is a mandatory parameter with type indicating the type of sql historian (i.e. sqlite) and params 
                    containing the path the database file.
    
    - tables_def - Optional parameter to provide custom table names for topics, data, and metadata.
    
    The configuration can be in a json or yaml formatted file.

    Yaml Format:

    ```yaml
    connection:
      # type should be sqlite
      type: sqlite
      params:
        # Relative to the agents data directory
        database: "data/historian.sqlite"
    
      tables_def:
        # prefix for data, topics, and (in version < 4.0.0 metadata tables)
        # default is ""
        table_prefix: ""
        # table name for time series data. default "data"
        data_table: data
        # table name for list of topics. default "topics"
        topics_table: topics
    ```
    
4. Install and start the volttron-sqlite-historian.

    ```shell
    vctl install volttron-sqlite-historian --agent-config <path to configuration> --start
    ```

5. View the status of the installed agent

    ```shell
    vctl status
    ```
