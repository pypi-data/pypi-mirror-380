    The Xena release of Glance is a midpoint in the process of
    refactoring how our policies are applied to API operations. The
    goal of applying policy enforcement in the API will ultimately
    increase the flexibility operators have over which users can do
    what operations to which images, and provides a path for compliant
    Secure RBAC and scoped tokens. In Xena, some policies are more
    flexible than they once were, allowing for more fine-grained
    assignment of responsibilities, but not all things are possible
    yet. If `enforce_secure_rbac` is not enabled, most things are
    still enforcing the legacy behavior of hard and fast
    admin-or-owner requirements.
