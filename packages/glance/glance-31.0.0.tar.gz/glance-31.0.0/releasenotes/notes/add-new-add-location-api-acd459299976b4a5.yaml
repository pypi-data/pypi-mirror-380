features:

    This release brings the additional functionality of adding new
    location to a ``queued`` state image which will replace the
    image-update mechanism for consumers like cinder and nova to
    address OSSN-0090 and OSSN-0065.
issues:
  - |
    In case of ``http`` store if bad value is passed for ``os_hash_value``
    in validation data then task fails which is expected but it stores
    location of the image which is wrong, that needs to be popped out.
    The location doesn't get deleted because deletion of locatio is not
    allowed for ``http`` store. Here image needs to be deleted as it is
    of no use.
  - |
    During validation of hashing data when do_secure_hash is `false`,
    we can just validate length expected for hash_algo and not actual
    expected hash value. If garbage hash_value with expected size has
    been provided, image becomes active after adding location but it will
    be of no use as download or boot will fail with corrupt image error.
