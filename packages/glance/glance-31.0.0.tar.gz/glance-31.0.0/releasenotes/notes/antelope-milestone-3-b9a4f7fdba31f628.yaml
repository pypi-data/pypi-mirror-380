    In this cycle Glance enabled the API policies (RBAC) new defaults and scope by
    default and removed the deprecated ``enforce_secure_rbac`` option which is no
    longer needed after switching to new defaults.
    The Default value of config options ``[oslo_policy] enforce_scope``
    and ``[oslo_policy] oslo_policy.enforce_new_defaults`` have been changed
    to ``True``. Old policies are still there but they are disabled by default.
