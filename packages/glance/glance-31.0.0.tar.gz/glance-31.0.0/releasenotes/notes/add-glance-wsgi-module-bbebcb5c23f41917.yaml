    A new file, ``glance/wsgi/api.py``, has been added as a place to hold a
    WSGI ``application`` object. This is intended to ease deployment by
    providing a consistent location for these objects. For example, if using
    uWSGI then instead of:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        wsgi-file = /bin/glance-wsgi-api

    You can now use:

    .. code-block:: ini

        [uwsgi]
        module = glance.wsgi.api:application

    This also simplifies deployment with other WSGI servers that expect module
    paths such as gunicorn.
