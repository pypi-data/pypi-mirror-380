    Glance now inspects image content on upload and import, checking format
    adherence with the declared `disk_format` and running safety checks on
    content it recognizes. The new config knob
    `[image_format]/require_image_format_match` controls whether or not images
    are rejected when the format set on image create does not match the content
    that is uploaded. Some images that are currently treated as `raw` may
    trigger safety check failures when examining the MBR record (or what glance
    thinks is an MBR). These may be legit failures (due to proliferation of
    GPT images with invalid Protective MBR structures) as well as other content
    that attempts to be PC-BIOS-Bootable and thus have a quasi-MBR structure
    ahead of the payload which may not be fully compliant. Thus a new config
    knob `[image_format]/gpt_safety_checks_nonfatal` is added to (by default)
    allow these failures to be non-fatal.

    Glance will check that uploaded content matches `disk_format` by default,
    so operators should be on the lookout for any false positives and be
    ready for reports of upload failures if users are currently not properly
    representing their uploads.
