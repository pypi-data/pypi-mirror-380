    The cinder store lazy migration code assumed that the user
    performing the GET was authorized to modify the image in order to
    perform the update. This will not be the case for shared or public
    images where the user is not the owner or an admin, and would
    result in a 404 to the user if a migration is needed but not
    completed. Now, we delay the migration if we are not sufficiently
    authorized, allowing the first GET by the owner (or an admin) to
    perform it. See Bug 1932337_ for more information.
