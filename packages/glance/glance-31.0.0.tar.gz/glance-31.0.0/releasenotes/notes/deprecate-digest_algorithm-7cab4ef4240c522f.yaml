deprecations:
  - |
    The ``digest_algorithm`` configuration option has been deprecated in this
    release and is subject to removal at the beginning of the F development
    cycle, following the
    `OpenStack standard deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    This option has had no effect since the removal of native SSL support.
