    This release brings additional functionality to the unified quota
    work done in the previous release. A usage API is now available,
    which provides a way for users to see their current quota limits
    and their active resource usage towards them. For more
    information, see the discovery section in the `api-ref
    <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#image-service-info-discovery>`_.
