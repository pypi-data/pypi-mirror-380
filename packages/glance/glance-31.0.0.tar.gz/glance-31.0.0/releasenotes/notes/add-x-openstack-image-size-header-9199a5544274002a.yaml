    Added support for the optional ``x-openstack-image-size`` header in image
    upload endpoints. This header allows clients to specify the expected size
    of image data in bytes when uploading images via the PUT
    ``/v2/images/{image_id}/file`` and PUT ``/v2/images/{image_id}/stage``
    endpoints.

    When the header is present, the server validates that the uploaded data
    size matches the specified value. If the actual size does not match the
    expected size, a 400 (Bad Request) response is returned. When the header
    is not present, the server calculates the image size based on the actual
    request body size.

    This feature improves data integrity validation during image uploads and
    helps prevent incomplete or corrupted uploads.
