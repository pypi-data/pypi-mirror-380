    The database migration engine used by Glance for database upgrades was
    changed from *SQLAlchemy Migrate* to *Alembic* in the 14.0.0 (Ocata)
    release. Support for *SQLAlchemy Migrate* has now been removed. This
    means in order to upgrade from a pre-Ocata release to Xena or later,
    you must upgrade to Wallaby or earlier first.
