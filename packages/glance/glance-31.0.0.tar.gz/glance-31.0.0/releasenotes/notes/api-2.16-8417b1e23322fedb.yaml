    When the Glance image cache is being used, the CURRENT version of
    the Image service API, as indicated in the ``GET /versions`` response,
    is 2.16.

    The Image service API call ``PUT /v2/cache/{image_id}`` now returns
    a 202 (Accepted) response code to indicate success.  In glance 24.0.0
    (the initial Yoga release), it had mistakenly returned a 200.

    Bug `1971521 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1971521>`_:
    Fixed the success response code of the REST API call
    ``PUT /v2/cache/{image_id}`` to be 202 (Accepted), following the
    original design of the feature.
