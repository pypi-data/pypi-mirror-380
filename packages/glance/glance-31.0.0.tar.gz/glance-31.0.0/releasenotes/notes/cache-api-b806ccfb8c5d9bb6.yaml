    This release introduces new APIs for cache related operations. This new
    version of the cache API will help administrators to cache images on
    dedicated glance nodes as well. For more information, see the
    ``Cache Manage`` section in the `api-ref-guide
    <https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#cache-manage>`_.
