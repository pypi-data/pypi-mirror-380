    The Image service API call ``DELETE /v2/cache/{image_id}`` and
    ``DELETE /v2/cache`` now returns a 204 (No Content) response code
    to indicate success. In glance 24.0.0 (the initial Yoga release),
    it had mistakenly returned a 200.

    Bug `1980049 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance/+bug/1980049>`_:
    Fixed the success response code of the REST API call
    ``DELETE /v2/cache/{image_id}`` and ``DELETE /v2/cache`` to be
    204 (No Content), following the original design of the feature.
