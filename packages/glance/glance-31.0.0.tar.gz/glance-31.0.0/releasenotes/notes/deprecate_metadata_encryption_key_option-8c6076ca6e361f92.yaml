    The Glance API configuration options ``metadata_encryption_key`` is
    deprecated in this release and is subject to removal at the beginning
    of the `F` (2025.2) development cycle.

    The `metadata_encryption_key` and it's related functioanlity don't
    serve the purpose of encryption of location metadata, whereas it encrypts
    location url only for specific APIs. Also if enabled this during an
    upgrade, may disrupt existing deployments, as it does not support/provide
    db upgrade script to encrypt existing location URLs. Moreover, its
    functionality for encrypting location URLs is inconsistent which
    resulting in download failures.
