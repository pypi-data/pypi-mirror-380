# Why HLS URLs Change on Refresh

The changing part of your URL (like `jeqMhkSBtKe_0prAhcFKXw==,1750869729`) is a security mechanism. Here's why it changes:

## 1. **Token-Based Authentication**
Most adult/video sites use temporary tokens to:
- Prevent direct hotlinking
- Limit sharing of URLs
- Enforce session-based access
- Track views accurately

## 2. **Components of the Changing Part**
The dynamic portion typically contains:
- **First part (before the comma)**: `jeqMhkSBtKe_0prAhcFKXw==`
  - This is usually a Base64-encoded token
  - Often contains expiration timestamp + signature
  - May include session ID or IP fingerprint

- **Second part (after comma)**: `1750869729`
  - This is almost certainly a Unix timestamp (seconds since 1970)
  - Current timestamp: `1750869729` = June 24, 2025 ~10:42 AM UTC

## 3. **How It Works Technically**
1. When you load the page, the server generates:
   - A new token tied to your session
   - Current timestamp
   - Cryptographic signature

2. These are combined into the URL component

3. When the CDN receives the request:
   ```
   if (token_is_valid && !token_expired && signature_matches) {
       serve_video();
   } else {
       403_Forbidden();
   }
   ```

## 4. **Practical Implications for Downloading**
- **URLs expire quickly** (often within minutes)
- **You can't reuse URLs** across sessions
- **Solutions**:
  - Always fetch fresh URL when needed
  - Use browser automation to get current URL
  - Reverse-engineer the token generation (if possible)

## Python Solution with Fresh URL Fetching

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re
import time

def get_fresh_m3u8_url(page_url):
    """Fetches current m3u8 URL from the page"""
    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36'
    }
    
    try:
        # 1. Load the video page
        response = requests.get(page_url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # 2. Find the video element
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        video_div = soup.find('div', {'data-video': True})
        
        if not video_div:
            raise ValueError("No video element found")
            
        # 3. Extract fresh URL (may need to parse JS)
        # Alternative: Use regex to find all potential URLs
        urls = re.findall(
            r'https?://cdn\d+\.hotleaks\.tv/[^/]+/\d+/sdb\d+/\d+/\d+/index\.m3u8',
            response.text
        )
        
        if urls:
            return urls[0]
            
        raise ValueError("No m3u8 URL found in page")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching fresh URL: {e}")
        return None

# Usage:
page_url = "https://hotleaks.tv/your-video-page"
m3u8_url = get_fresh_m3u8_url(page_url)

if m3u8_url:
    print(f"Fresh URL: {m3u8_url}")
    # Now use the download function from previous examples
else:
    print("Failed to get current URL")
```

## Advanced Alternative: Reverse-Engineering

If you want persistent access without page scraping:

1. **Inspect Network Requests**:
   - Look for XHR requests that might generate tokens
   - Common endpoints: `/api/token`, `/generate-url`

2. **Check JavaScript**:
   - Search for `new Date()` or `Date.now()` calls
   - Look for functions named `generateToken()` or similar

3. **Python Implementation** (hypothetical):
```python
import base64
import time
import hmac
import hashlib

def generate_token(secret_key):
    timestamp = int(time.time())
    message = f"{timestamp}"
    signature = hmac.new(
        secret_key.encode(),
        message.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).digest()
    return f"{base64.b64encode(signature).decode()},{timestamp}"

# This requires knowing the site's secret key and algorithm
```

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of this explanation? The changing URLs are definitely a security measure, but there are ways to work with them.
