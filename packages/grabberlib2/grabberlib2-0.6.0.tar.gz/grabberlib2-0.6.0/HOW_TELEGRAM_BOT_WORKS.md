Great question — the “direction” depends on how you connect your bot to Telegram. There are two ways:

1) Long polling (what your script already does)

Who talks to whom?
Your VPS pulls updates from Telegram’s Bot API using your bot token. Telegram doesn’t need to “know” your VPS address at all.

```
[Telegram users] -> [Telegram servers]
                          ↑
                     (getUpdates)
                          ↑
                   your bot on VPS
```

So how do links/messages reach your code?
	•	You start your script with BOT_TOKEN set.
	•	Your code calls getUpdates in a loop (await dp.start_polling(bot) in aiogram 3).
	•	Telegram queues updates for that bot token; your VPS keeps asking “got anything new for token X?”, and Telegram returns the updates.
	•	Your handlers run, and you can reply or forward to channels as your code dictates.

What you must configure:
	•	BOT_TOKEN — that’s the “routing key.” If it’s correct, your code receives all messages sent to that bot.
	•	If you want to post to channels, your code needs the channel chat IDs (the -100… numbers). Make the bot an admin in those channels and keep the IDs in your settings (e.g., your CHANNELS mapping).
	•	If you want the bot to react in groups, add it to the group and (optionally) disable privacy mode via @BotFather so it can see all messages.

No domain, no ports, no HTTPS required. A plain VPS behind NAT works fine.

2) Webhook (only if you choose to)

Who talks to whom?
Telegram pushes updates to your HTTPS URL that you register.

```
[Telegram users] -> [Telegram servers] -> POST https://your.domain/telegram
                                                |
                                          your bot code
```

What you must configure:
	•	A public HTTPS endpoint (domain + TLS).
	•	Run your bot as a web app (e.g., aiogram webhook/uvicorn).
	•	Tell Telegram where to POST:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
     -d "url=https://your.domain/telegram"
```

•	To switch back to polling:

```
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot$BOT_TOKEN/deleteWebhook"
```

Polling and webhooks are mutually exclusive: if a webhook is set, getUpdates (polling) won’t return anything.

Quick checklist (for your current polling setup)
	1.	Create bot with @BotFather → copy BOT_TOKEN.
	2.	Export BOT_TOKEN in your VPS (or put it in .env).
	3.	Start your script (start_polling).
	4.	(If posting to channels) Add the bot as Admin in each channel and put their -100… IDs in your config.
	5.	Test: DM your bot or post in a group it’s in; you should see your handlers fire in your VPS logs.
