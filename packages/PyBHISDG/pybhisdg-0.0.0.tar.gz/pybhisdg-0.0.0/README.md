# PyBHISDG

This is a tool for estimating the Brain-Heart Interaction based on ECG and EEG derived signals. It is an implementation of the SDG model put forward by Catrambone, V., Greco, A., Vanello, N. et al. Time-Resolved Directional Brain–Heart Interplay Measurement Through Synthetic Data Generation Models. Ann Biomed Eng 47, 1479–1489 (2019).

The functionality is largely translate from the open-source MATLAB implementation provided at:
