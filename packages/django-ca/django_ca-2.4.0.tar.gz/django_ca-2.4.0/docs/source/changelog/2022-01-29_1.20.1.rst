.. WARNING::

   **docker-compose users:** Update from 1.18 or earlier? See :ref:`the update notes <update_119>` or you
   might loose private keys!

This is a pseudo-release to add the docker-compose file for the 1.20.0 release, which was missing in said
release. There are no code changes otherwise. Thus no release artifacts (wheels, docker images etc) where
produced for this release.

* Add docker-compose file missing from the 1.20.0 release.
* Switch the default branch on GitHub to ``main``.
