##################

* The subject given in the :command:`manage.py init_ca` and :command:`manage.py sign_cert` is now given in the
  same form that is frequently used by OpenSSL, ``/C=AT/L=...``.
* On the command line, both CAs and certificates can now be named either by their CommonName or
  with their serial. The serial can be given with only the first few letters as long as it's
  unique, as it is matched as long as the serial starts with the given serial.
* Expiry time of CRLs can now be specified in seconds. :command:`manage.py dump_crl` now uses the
  ``--expires`` instead of the old ``--days`` parameter.
* The admin interface now accounts for cases where some or all CAs are not usable because the private key is
  not accessible. Such a scenario might occur if the private keys are hosted on a different machine.
* The app now provides a generic view to generate CRLs. See :doc:`/crl` for more information.
* Fix the display of the default value of the --ca arguments.
* Move this ChangeLog from a top-level Markdown file to this location.
* Fix shell example when issuing certificates.
