1.5.0 (2017-03-05)
##################

* Completely remove pyOpenSSL and consistently use `cryptography <https://cryptography.io/>`_.
* Due to the transition to cryptography, some features have been removed:

  * The ``tlsfeature`` extension is no longer supported. It will be again once cryptography adds support.
  * The ``msCodeInd``, ``msCodeCom``, ``msCTLSign``, ``msEFS`` values for the ExtendedKeyUsage extension are
    no longer supported. Support for these was largely academic anyway, so they most likely will not be added
    again.
  * ``TEXT`` is no longer a supported output format for dumping certificates.

* The ``keyUsage`` extension is now marked as critical for certificate authorities.
* Add the ``privilegeWithdrawn`` and ``aACompromise`` attributes for revocation lists.
