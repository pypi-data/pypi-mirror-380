Docker
******

* Base the :doc:`Docker image </quickstart/docker>` on ``python:3-alpine`` (instead of ``python:3``), yielding
  a much smaller image (~965MB -> ~235MB).
* Run complete test-suite in a separate build stage when building the image.
* Provide ``uwsgi.ini`` for fast deployments with the uWSGI protocol.
* Add support for passing additional parameters to uWSGI using the ``DJANGO_CA_UWSGI_PARAMS`` environment
  variable.
* Create user/group with a predefined UID/GID of 9000 to allow better sharing of containers.
* Add ``/usr/share/django-ca/`` as named volume, allowing a setup where an external web server serves static
  files.
* Add documentation on how to run the container in combination with an external web server.
* Add documentation on how to run the container as a different UID/GID.
