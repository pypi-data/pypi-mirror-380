* Update requirements.
* Use `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org>`_ for continuous integration. **django-ca** is now tested
  with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and nightly, using Django 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10.
* Fix a few test errors for Django 1.8.
* Examples now consistently use 4096 bit certificates.
* Some functionality is now migrated to ``cryptography`` in the ongoing process to deprecate
  pyOpenSSL (which is no longer maintained).
* OCSPView now supports directly passing the public key as bytes. As a consequence, a bad
  certificate is now only detected at runtime.
