1.8.0 (2018-07-08)
##################

* Add :doc:`Django signals </signals>` to important events to let users add custom actions (such as email
  notifications etc.) to those events (fixes `#39 <https://github.com/mathiasertl/django-ca/issues/39>`_).
* Provide a Docker container for fast deployment of **django-ca**.
* Add the :ref:`CA_CUSTOM_APPS <settings-ca-custom-apps>` setting to let users that use **django-ca** as a
  :doc:`standalone project </quickstart/from_source>` add custom apps, e.g. to register signals.
* Make the ``otherName`` extension actually usable and tested (see `PR47
  <https://github.com/mathiasertl/django-ca/pull/47>`_)
* Add the ``smartcardLogon`` and ``msKDC`` extended key usage types. They are needed for some AD and OpenLDAP
  improvements (see `PR46 <https://github.com/mathiasertl/django-ca/pull/46>`_)
* Improve compatibility with newer ``idna`` versions (``".com"`` now also throws an error).
* Drop support for Django 1.8 and Django 1.10.
* Improve support for yet-to-be-released Django 2.1.
* Fix admin view of certificates with no SubjectAlternativeName extension.
