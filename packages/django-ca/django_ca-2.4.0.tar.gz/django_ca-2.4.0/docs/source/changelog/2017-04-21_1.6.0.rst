*****************************
New features and improvements
*****************************

* Support CSRs in DER format when signing a certificate via :command:`manage.py sign_cert`.
* Support encrypting private keys of CAs with a password.
* Support Django 1.11.
* Allow creating CRLs of disabled CAs via :command:`manage.py dump_crl`.
* Validate DNSNames when parsing general names. This means that signing a certificate with CommonName that is
  not a valid domain name fails if it should also be added as SubjectAlternativeName extension (see
  ``--cn-in-san`` option).
* When configuring :py:class:`~django_ca.views.OCSPView`, the responder key and certificate are verified
  during configuration. An erroneous configuration thus throws an error on startup, not during runtime.
* The test suite now tests certificate signatures itself via ``pyOpenSSL``,  so an independent library is used
  for verification.

Bugfixes
********

* Fix the ``authorityKeyIdentifier`` extension when signing certificates with an intermediate CA.
* Fix creation of intermediate CAs.
