* Fix various operations when ``USE_TZ`` is ``True``.
* Email addresses are now independently validated by ``validate_email``. cryptography 2.1 no longer validates
  email addresses itself.
* Require ``cryptography>=2.1``. Older versions should not be broken, but the output changes breaking
  :py:mod:`doctests <doctest>`, meaning they're no longer tested either.
* CA keys are no longer stored with colons in their filename, fixing ``init_ca`` under Windows.
