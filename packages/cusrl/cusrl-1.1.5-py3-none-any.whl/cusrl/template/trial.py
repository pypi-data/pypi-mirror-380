class Trial:
    """A class to manage and load checkpoints.

    This class provides a convenient way to interact with the output of a
    training run (a "trial"). It can be initialized with a path to:
      - An experiment's home directory (e.g., `Env:Algo/`)
      - A trial's home directory (e.g., `Env:Algo/trial_1/`)
      - A specific checkpoint file (e.g., `Env:Algo/trial_1/ckpt/ckpt_100.pt`)

    The class automatically discovers information like the experiment name,
    algorithm, environment, and available checkpoint iterations.

    Args:
        path (str):
            The path to the experiment, trial directory or a specific checkpoint
            file. If an experiment is provided, the latest trial is loaded. If a
            trial directory is provided, the latest checkpoint is loaded.
            Otherwise, the specific checkpoint file is expected.
        verbose (bool, optional):
            If True, prints the path of the loaded checkpoint. Defaults to True.

    Attributes:
        home (Path):
            The absolute path to the trial's root directory.
        name (str):
            The name of the trial, derived from its directory name.
        experiment_name (str | None):
            The name of the experiment, if the directory name follows the
            'env:algo' convention.
        algorithm_name (str | None):
            The name of the algorithm, parsed from the experiment name.
        environment_name (str | None):
            The name of the environment, parsed from the experiment name.
        iteration (int):
            The iteration number of the loaded checkpoint.
        checkpoint_path (Path):
            The full path to the selected checkpoint file.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError:
            If the specified path does not exist.
        ValueError:
            If the path points to a file that is not a valid checkpoint file.
