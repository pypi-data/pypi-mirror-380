**Key Features**

- **Easy to use, yet very powerful:** Start your first app in 3 lines.
  The Immediate Mode GUI (IMGUI) paradigm is simple and powerful,
  letting you focus on the creative aspects of your projects.

- **A lot of widgets and libraries:** All of Dear ImGui along with a
  suite of additional libraries for plotting, node editing, markdown
  rendering, and much more.

- **Cross-platform in C++ and Python:** Works on Windows, Linux, macOS,
  iOS, Android, and WebAssembly!

- **Web ready**: Develop full web applications, in C++ via Emscripten;
  or in Python thanks to ImGui Bundle’s integration within *Pyodide*

- **Always up-to-date:** The libraries are always very close to the
  latest version of Dear ImGui. This is also true for Python developers,
  since the bindings are automatically generated.

- **Interactive Demos and Documentation:** Quickly get started with our
  interactive manual and demos that showcase the capabilities of the
  pack. Read or copy-paste the source code (Python and C++) directly
  from the interactive manual!

- **Fast:** Rendering is done via OpenGL (or any other renderer you
  choose), through native code.

- **Beautifully documented Python bindings and stubs:** The Python
  bindings stubs reflect the C++ API and documentation, serving as a
  reference and aiding autocompletion in your IDE. See for example the
  [stubs for
  imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/imgui/__init__.pyi),
  and [for
  hello\_imgui](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/blob/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/hello_imgui.pyi)
  (which complete the [hello\_imgui
  manual](https://pthom.github.io/hello_imgui/book/intro.html)).

**Online playground in Pure Python (via Pyodide)**

Since ImGui Bundle is available in Python and Pyodide, an [online
playground](https://traineq.org/imgui_bundle_online/projects/imgui_bundle_playground/)
will enable you to run and edit various ImGui applications in the
browser without any setup.

A big thank you to their authors for their awesome work!

# Install for Python

## Install from pypi

    pip install imgui-bundle  
    pip install opencv-python 
    pip install pyGLM 

- imgui\_bundle: Binary wheels are available for Windows, MacOS and
  Linux. If a compilation from source is needed, the build process might
  take up to 5 minutes, and will require an internet connection.

- OpenCV: in order to run the immvision module, install opencv-python.
  The alternative OpenCV versions, such as opencv-python-headless
  (headless) opencv-contrib-python (with extra modules) also work.

- pyGLM: in order to run the demo, install pyGLM

**Platform notes**

- *Windows*: Under windows, you might need to install [msvc
  redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022).

- *macOS* : under macOS, if a binary wheel is not available (e.g. for
  older macOS versions), pip will try to compile from source. This might
  fail if you do not have XCode installed. In this case, install
  imgui-bundle with the following command
  `SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=0 pip install --only-binary=:all: imgui_bundle`

## Install from source

    git clone https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle.git
    cd imgui_bundle
    git submodule update --init --recursive 
    pip install -v . 
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install pyGLM

- Since there are lots of submodules, this might take a few minutes

- The build process might take up to 5 minutes

## Run the python demo

Simply run `demo_imgui_bundle`.

The source for the demos can be found inside
[bindings/imgui\_bundle/demos\_python](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle/tree/main/bindings/imgui_bundle/demos_python).

Consider `demo_imgui_bundle` as an always available manual for Dear
ImGui Bundle with lots of examples and related code source.

# Closing words

## Who is this project for

Dear ImGui Bundle aims to make applications prototyping fast and easy,
in a multiplatform / multi-tooling context. The intent is to reduce the
time between an idea and a first GUI prototype down to almost zero.

It is well adapted for

- developers and researchers who want to switch easily between and
  research and development environment by facilitating the port of
  research artifacts

- beginners and developers who want to quickly develop an application
  without learning a GUI framework

### Who is this project **not** for

You should prefer a more complete framework (such as Qt for example) if
your intent is to build a fully fledged application, with support for
internationalization, advanced styling, etc.

Also, the library makes no guarantee of ABI stability, and its API is
opened to slight adaptations and breaking changes if they are found to
make the overall usage better and/or safer.

## Acknowledgments

Dear ImGui Bundle would not be possible without the work of the authors
of "Dear ImGui", and especially [Omar
Cornut](https://www.miracleworld.net/).

It also includes a lot of other projects, and I’d like to thank their
authors for their awesome work!

A particular mention for [Evan Pezent](https://evanpezent.com/) (author
of ImPlot), [Cédric Guillemet](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet)
(author of ImGuizmo), [Balázs
Jákó](https://merlin3d.wordpress.com/about/) (author of
ImGuiColorTextEdit), and [Michał Cichoń](https://github.com/thedmd)
(author of imgui-node-editor), and [Dmitry
Mekhontsev](https://github.com/mekhontsev) (author of imgui-md), [Andy
Borrel](https://github.com/andyborrell) (author of imgui-tex-inspect,
another image debugging tool, which I discovered long after having
developed immvision).

This doc was built using [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/).

Immvision was inspired by [The Image
Debugger](https://billbaxter.com/projects/imdebug/), by Bill Baxter.

## Alternatives

[pyimgui](https://pyimgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides
battle-tested comprehensive python bindings for ImGui. I worked with
this project a lot, and contributed a bit to it. In the end, I had to
develop a separate project, in order to be able to add auto-generated
and auto-documented python modules.

[Dear PyGui](https://dearpygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
([repository](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui)) provides python
bindings for ImGui with a lot of addons, and a more pythonesque API,
which makes it perhaps more suited for Python only projects.

## About the author

Dear ImGui Bundle is developed by Pascal Thomet. I am reachable on my
[Github page](https://github.com/pthom). I sometimes
[blog](http://code-ballads.net/). There is a
[playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaJx_KrDECZPzttQ77Gv8DD7OAUwmtWUc)
related to ImGui Bundle on YouTube.

I have a past in computer vision, and a lot of experience in the
trenches between development and research teams; and I found ImGui to be
a nice way to reduce the delay between a research prototype and its use
in production code.

I also have an inclination for self documenting code, and the doc you
are reading was a way to explore new ways to document projects.

## How is Dear ImGui Bundle developed

The development of the initial version of Dear ImGui Bundle took about
one year at full time.

The bindings are auto-generated thanks to an advanced parser, so that
they are easy to keep up to date.

Please be tolerant if you find issues! Dear ImGui Bundle is developed
for free, under a very permissive license, by one main author (and most
of its API comes from external libraries).

If you need consulting about this library or about the bindings
generator in the context of a commercial project, please contact me by
email.

Contributions are welcome!

### History

Three of my past projects gave me the idea to develop this library.

- [ImGui
  Manual](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html),
  an interactive manual for Dear ImGui, which I developed in June 2020

- [implot demo](https://traineq.org/implot_demo/src/implot_demo.html)
  which I developed in 2020.

- [imgui\_datascience](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_datascience), a
  python package I developed in 2018 for image analysis and debugging.
  Its successor is immvision.

Developments for Dear ImGui Bundle and its related automatic binding
generator began in january 2022.
