  2. AKShare Eastmoney (trading hours)
  3. Alternative sources (24/7 available)
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging for each news source

### Technical Details

  - `ak.news_cctv()` - 12+ articles (evening updates)
  - `ak.stock_news_main_cx()` - 16k+ articles (24/7)
- All NewsArticle objects now include required `scraped_at` timestamp
- News fetching success rate: 90%+ in evening hours

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- Fixed `calculate_indicators` tool - now fetches historical data automatically
- Fixed `get_sentiment_analysis` tool - implemented fault-tolerant data fetching
- Fixed `get_news` tool - multi-source fallback mechanism
- Fixed resource URI parsing for `AnyUrl` objects

### Added
- Automatic historical data fetching for technical indicators (100 days default)
- Comprehensive test suite (90% tool success rate)

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added
- Initial release with 10 MCP Tools
- 10 MCP Resources for market data
- Published to PyPI

## [0.0.5] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed MCP server startup timeout issue
  - Changed stderr logging level from INFO to ERROR to prevent interference with MCP stdio protocol
  - MCP servers use stdin/stdout for JSON-RPC communication, excessive stderr output was breaking the protocol
  - Server now starts reliably within timeout limits (< 60 seconds)
- Updated version display across all modules to 0.0.5
- Improved startup reliability for Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

### Changed
- Console logging now only shows ERROR level and above to stderr
- All INFO/DEBUG logs go to file only (`~/.stock-mcp-server/logs/`)
- Reduced noise in MCP client logs while maintaining full debug info in files

### Technical Details
- Modified `src/stock_mcp_server/utils/logger.py` to use ERROR-only stderr output
- MCP protocol requires clean stdio channels - now fully compliant
- File logging remains at DEBUG level for troubleshooting

### Why This Matters
- Previous versions (0.0.3, 0.0.4) would timeout during startup in Claude Desktop
- Caused by INFO logs to stderr disrupting MCP's JSON-RPC communication
- Now reliably connects and responds within seconds

## [0.0.4] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed Decimal JSON serialization error affecting 6 core tools
  - Added `json_utils.py` module with `sanitize_for_json()` function
  - Fixed `get_market_data` - now properly serializes Decimal values to float
  - Fixed `get_money_flow` - now properly serializes capital flow data
  - Fixed `get_sentiment_analysis` - fixed service layer interface mismatch and Decimal conversion
  - Fixed `get_news` - now properly handles Decimal importance scores
  - Fixed `generate_advice` - now properly serializes all recommendation data
  - Fixed `get_market_overview` - now properly serializes aggregated market data
- **Critical**: Fixed `get_sentiment_analysis` parameter mismatch
  - Rewrote service layer call to properly fetch and pass market data
  - Fixed "got an unexpected keyword argument 'date'" error
  - Now correctly calculates sentiment with index, breadth, and capital flow data

### Changed
- Improved JSON serialization across all tools with recursive type conversion
- Enhanced error handling in sentiment analysis with detailed error messages
- All tools now use consistent `sanitize_for_json()` before returning data

### Technical Details
- Created `src/stock_mcp_server/utils/json_utils.py` utility module
- Implemented recursive Decimal-to-float conversion for nested structures
- Updated 7 tool files to use new JSON serialization utilities
- All fixes verified with automated tests (7/7 tests passed)

### Compatibility
- Tool contract specifications remain unchanged
- All existing tool calls will work with no breaking changes
- Improved reliability and stability for production use

## [0.0.3] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed tool listing error: `name 'true' is not defined`
  - Changed all JSON schema boolean defaults from lowercase `true`/`false` to Python `True`/`False`
  - Tools now correctly register and appear in Claude Desktop (10 tools + 10 resources)
- **Critical**: Fixed resource reading errors
  - Added URL decoding for resource URIs (e.g., `%7Bdate%7D` → `{date}`)
  - Added proper JSON serialization for Decimal and other non-JSON types
  - Resources now work correctly when accessed from Claude Desktop

### Changed
- Improved error handling for resource access
- Enhanced JSON serialization with recursive type conversion

## [0.0.2] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed AttributeError: 'Config' object has no attribute 'cache_enabled'
  - Removed references to non-existent `cache_enabled` attribute in server.py
  - Cache is now always enabled (as intended)
  - Server now starts successfully in Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

### Changed
- Updated version display in server startup logs from 0.1.0 to 0.0.2

## [0.0.1] - 2025-10-01 [YANKED]
