## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An AI assistant user wants to get real-time Chinese A-share market insights through natural conversation. They ask questions like "How is the Shanghai index performing today?" or "What's the market sentiment?" and receive comprehensive analysis including current prices, technical indicators, news sentiment, and actionable investment recommendations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an AI assistant with MCP support, **When** a user asks about current Shanghai index performance, **Then** the system provides real-time price data, change percentage, trading volume, and market breadth statistics

2. **Given** current market data is available, **When** a user requests technical analysis, **Then** the system calculates and returns relevant indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.) with clear buy/sell/hold signals

3. **Given** market news is being monitored, **When** a user asks for today's important news, **Then** the system provides categorized news with sentiment analysis and impact assessment

4. **Given** all data sources are available, **When** a user requests investment advice, **Then** the system generates multi-dimensional analysis (technical, fundamental, sentiment, capital flow) with specific recommendations and risk warnings

5. **Given** a user wants to track specific sectors, **When** they request sector performance data, **Then** the system shows ranking by performance, capital flow, and identifies leading stocks

6. **Given** market is closed, **When** a user requests data, **Then** the system provides the most recent available data with clear timestamp indicating data age

7. **Given** multiple data queries in sequence, **When** a user makes repeated requests, **Then** the system uses cached data appropriately to maintain quick response times

8. **Given** market data shows extreme conditions, **When** generating advice, **Then** the system includes prominent risk warnings about market volatility or unusual conditions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when data sources are temporarily unavailable?
  - System should provide cached data with clear staleness indicators
  - System should gracefully degrade and explain which features are unavailable
  
- How does system handle malformed or invalid date requests?
  - System should validate date inputs and provide helpful error messages
  - System should suggest valid date ranges
  
- What happens during market holidays or non-trading hours?
  - System should clearly indicate market status
  - System should provide last trading day's data
  
- How does system handle concurrent requests from multiple AI assistants?
  - System should handle at least 10 concurrent requests without degradation
  - System should use caching to minimize redundant data fetching
  
- What happens when news scraping fails or is blocked?
  - System should continue operating with other features
  - System should log errors for monitoring
  
- How does system handle extremely volatile market days (circuit breakers)?
  - System should flag unusual market conditions
  - System should adjust sentiment calculations accordingly
