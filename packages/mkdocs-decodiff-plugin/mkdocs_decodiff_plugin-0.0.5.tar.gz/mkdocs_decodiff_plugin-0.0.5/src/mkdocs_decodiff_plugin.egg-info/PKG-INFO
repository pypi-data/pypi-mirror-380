## How to Use

### Install

```shell
pip install mkdocs-decodiff-plugin
```

### mkdocs.yml

```yml
plugins:
 - decodiff:
      base: main
      dir: docs
      change_list_file: docs/changes.md
```

* **base**:

 Reference for `git diff`. You can specify a hash, tag name, or branch name.

 ```
 git diff {base}
 ```
* **dir**:

 Target directory.

 ```
 git diff -- {dir}
 ```

* **change_list_file**:
  
 [Changes list file](#change_list_file)


## change_list_file

Collect change links in this file as a list.

```markdown
# Changes

<!-- decodiff: Written by decodiff from here -->
## [index.md](index.md)

* [new section](index.md#decodiff-anchor-1)

<!-- decodiff: end -->
```

The part between the `<!-- decodiff: -->` tags is generated by decodiff, but the rest can be modified.

```markdown
# You can change

You can change

<!-- decodiff: Written by decodiff from here -->

This section is overwritten by decodiff

<!-- decodiff: end -->

You can change
```

## NOT supported

* Changes in a code block
* Changes in a table
* Changes in HTML blocks
* Character unit changes

## Behavior

* Retrieve diff data using `git diff`
* Add an HTML tag to each diff line. For example:
    * `<span id="decodiff-hunk-1" class="decodiff">text</span>`
    * Preserve leading markup, such as headings (`#`) and bullet points (`*`)
* Create a diff list file containing a list of links
