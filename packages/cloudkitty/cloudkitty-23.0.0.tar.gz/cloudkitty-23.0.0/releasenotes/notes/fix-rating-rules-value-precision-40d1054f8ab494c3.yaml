    Allow rating rules that have more than 2 digits in integer part.

    Currently, CloudKitty only allows creating rating rules as
    ``99.999999999999999999999999``. Therefore, for prices equal to or higher
    than 100, we would not be able to use them. This patch will enable
    operators to use any value between ``0`` and ``999999999999`` (in the
    integer part of the number), which will provide more flexibility.
