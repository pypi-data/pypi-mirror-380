    CloudKitty will always use the correct metadata for the
    processing and reprocessing jobs. This means, we always use
    the metadata for the timestamp that we are collecting at
    Gnocchi backend.This is achieved with the use of
    ``use_history=true`` in Gnocchi, which was released under
    `version 4.5.0 <https://github.com/gnocchixyz/gnocchi/releases/tag/4.5.0>`__.
    Before that release, the ``aggregates`` API would only return
    the latest metadata for the resource of the metric being handled.
    Therefore, for CloudKitty processing and reprocessing, we would
    always have the possibility of using the wrong attribute version
    to rate the computing resources.
