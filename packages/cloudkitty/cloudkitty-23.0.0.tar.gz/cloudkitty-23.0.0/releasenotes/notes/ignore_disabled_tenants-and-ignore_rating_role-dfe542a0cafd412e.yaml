    Two new options ``ignore_disabled_tenants`` and ``ignore_rating_role``
    were added in the ``fetcher_keystone`` section. ``ignore_disabled_tenants``
    skips disabled tenants when doing the rating. ``ignore_rating_role``
    rates everyone, without reading the rating role for each project, which
    can be resource consuming.
