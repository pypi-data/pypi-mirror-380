# RASCAL - Resources for Analyzing Speech in Clinical Aphasiology Labs

RASCAL is a tool designed to facilitate the analysis of speech in clinical aphasiology research. It processes CHAT-formatted (.cha) transcriptions, organizes data into structured tiers, and automates key analytical steps in transcription reliability, CU coding, word counting, and core lexicon analysis.

## Web App

You can use RASCAL in your browser — no installation required:

👉 [Launch the RASCAL Web App](https://rascal.streamlit.app/)

---

## Installation

We recommend installing RASCAL into a dedicated virtual environment using Anaconda:

### 1. Create and activate your environment:

```bash
conda create --name rascal python=3.12
conda activate rascal
```

### 2. Install RASCAL directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install rascal-speech
```

### ...or from GitHub:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nmccloskey/rascal.git@main
```

---

## Setup

To prepare for running RASCAL, complete the following steps:

### 1. Create your working directory:

We recommend creating a fresh project directory where you'll run your analysis.

Example structure:

```plaintext
your_project/
├── config.yaml           # Configuration file (see below)
└── rascal_data/
    └── input/            # Place your CHAT (.cha) files and/or Excel data here
                          # (RASCAL will make an output directory)
```

### 2. Provide a `config.yaml` file

This file specifies the directories, coders, reliability settings, and tier structure.

You can download the example config file from the repo or create your own like this:

```yaml
input_dir: rascal_data/input
output_dir: rascal_data/output
reliability_fraction: 0.2
coders:
- '1'
- '2'
- '3'
CU_paradigms:
- SAE
- AAE
exclude_participants:
- INV
strip_clan: true
prefer_correction: true
lowercase: true
tiers:
  site:
    values:
    - AC
    - BU
    - TU
    partition: true
    blind: true
  test:
    values:
    - Pre
    - Post
    - Maint
    blind: true
  study_id:
    values: (AC|BU|TU)\d+
  narrative:
    values:
    - CATGrandpa
    - BrokenWindow
    - RefusedUmbrella
    - CatRescue
    - BirthdayScene
```

### Explanation:

- General

  - `reliability_fraction` - the proportion of data to subset for reliability (default 20%).

  - `coders` - alphanumeric coder identifiers (2 required for function **g** and 3 for **c**, see below).

  - `CU_paradigms` - allows users to accommodate multiple dialects if desired. If at least two paradigms are entered, parallel coding columns will be prepared and processed in all CU functions.

  - `exclude_participants` - speakers appearing in .cha files to exclude from transcription reliability and CU coding (neutral utterances).

- Transcription Reliability

  - `strip_clan` - removes CLAN markup but preserve speech-like content, including filled pauses (e.g., '&um' -> 'um') and partial words.

  - `prefer_correction` - toggles policy for accepted corrections '[: x] [*]': True keeps x, False keeps original.

  - `lowercase` - toggles case regularization.

**Specifying tiers:**
The tier system facilitates tabularization by associating a unit of analysis with its possible values and extracting this information from the file name of individual transcripts.

- **Multiple values**: enter as a comma- or newline-separated list. These are treated as **literal choices** and combined into a regex internally. See below examples.
  - *narrative*: `BrokenWindow, RefusedUmbrella, CatRescue`
  - *test*: `PreTx, PostTx`
  
- **Single value**: treated as a **regular expression** and validated immediately. Examples include:
  - Digits only: `\\d+`
  - Lab site + digits: `(AC|BU|TU)\\d+`
  - Three uppercase letters + three digits: `[A-Z]{3}\\d{3}`

- **Tier attributes**
  - **Partition**: creates separate coding files and **separate reliability** subsets by that tier. In this example, separate CU coding files will be generated for each site (AC, BU, TU), but not for each narrative or test value.
  - **Blind**: generates blind codes for CU summaries (function **j** below).

***Example: Tier-Based Tabularization from Filenames (according to the above config).***

Source files:
- `TU88PreTxBrokenWindow.cha`
- `BU77Maintenance_CatRescue.cha`

Tabularization:

| Site | Test  | ParticipantID | Narrative     |
|------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| TU   | Pre   | TU88          | BrokenWindow  |
| BU   | Maint | BU77          | CatRescue     |

## Running the Program

Once installed, RASCAL can be run from any directory using the command-line interface:

```bash
rascal <step or function>
```

For example, to run the CU coding analysis function:

```bash
rascal f
```

## 📊 RASCAL Workflow

Below is the current RASCAL pipeline, represented as a flow chart:

![RASCAL Flowchart](images/RASCAL_workflowchart.svg)

Stages 2, 5, & 8 are entirely manual. Dashed arrows show the alternate inputs to function **n**: function **d** output is required, and **f** output is optional.

The minimal command for batched CoreLex analysis of .cha-formatted transcripts is:

```bash
rascal dn
```

## Notes on Input Transcriptions

- `.cha` files must be formatted correctly according to CHAT conventions.
- Ensure filenames match tier values as specified in `config.yaml`.
- RASCAL searches tier values using exact spelling and capitalization.

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for its testing suite.  
All tests are located under the `tests/` directory, organized by module/function.

### Running Tests
To run the full suite:

```bash
pytest
```
Run with verbose output:
```bash
pytest -v
```
Run a specific test file:
```bash
pytest tests/test_samples/test_run_corelex.py
```

### Notes
- Tests stub out heavy dependencies (e.g., `openpyxl`, external web requests) to keep them fast and reproducible.
- Many tests use temporary directories (`tmp_path`) to simulate file I/O without affecting your real data.

## Acknowledgments

RASCAL builds on and integrates functionality from two excellent open-source tools which I highly recommend to researchers and clinicians working with language data:

- [**batchalign2**](https://github.com/TalkBank/batchalign2) – Developed by the TalkBank team, batchalign provides a robust backend for automatic speech recognition. RASCAL was designed to function downstream of this system, leveraging its debulletized `.cha` files as input. This integration allows researchers to significantly expedite batch transcription, which without an ASR springboard might bottleneck discourse analysis.

- [**coreLexicon**](https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/coreLexicon) – A web-based interface for Core Lexicon analysis developed by Rob Cavanaugh, et al. RASCAL implements its own Core Lexicon analysis that has high reliability with this web app: ICC(2) values (two-way random, absolute agreement) on primary metrics were 0.9627 for accuracy (number of core words) and 0.9689 for efficiency (core words per minute) - measured on 402 narratives (Brokem Window, Cat Rescue, and Refused Umbrella) from our conversation treatment study. RASCAL does not use the webapp but accesses the normative data associated with this repository (using Google sheet IDs) to calculate percentiles. 

  - **Inspiration & overlap:** RASCAL’s output table design was directly inspired by the original web app, with many of the same fields (accuracy, efficiency, percentiles, CoreLex tokens produced).
  - **Enhancements:** RASCAL extends this model by (a) supporting batch analysis of uploaded/input tabular data (rather than manual entry through a web interface), and (b) including some new metrics, particularly a normalized lexicon coverage, which enables aggregate comparisons across narratives.
  - **Recommended use cases:** The original web app remains an excellent choice for users working with a small number of samples who want individualized reports, while RASCAL's CoreLex functionality fills the niche of higher-throughput analysis ready for downstream statistical workflows.
