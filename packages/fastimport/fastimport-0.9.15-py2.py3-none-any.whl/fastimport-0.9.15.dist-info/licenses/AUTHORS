Ian Clatworthy wrote bzr-fastimport, which included a lot of generic code for
parsing and generating fastimport streams. Jelmer Vernooij split out
into its own separate package (python-fastimport) so it can be used by other
projects, and is its current maintainer.

FÃ©lix Mattrat ported python-fastimport to Python 3.
