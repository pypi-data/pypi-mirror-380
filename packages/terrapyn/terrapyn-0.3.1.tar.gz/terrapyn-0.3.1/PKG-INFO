Toolkit to manipulate Earth Observation Data: Remote Sensing, Climate and Weather models. Designed to work with `Pandas`/`GeoPandas` and `Xarray` data structures, implementing `Dask` where possible.

The name is pronounced the same as "terrapin", a type of [fresh water turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin)

## Terrapyn Package Structure

This package is structured with optional modules as separate packages

### Core Package: `terrapyn`
- **Installation**: `pip install terrapyn`
- **Contains**: Core functionality (utils, stats, indices, etc.)
- **Imports**: `import terrapyn as tp`

### Earth Engine Module: `terrapyn-ee`
- **Installation**: `pip install terrapyn-ee`
- **Contains**: Earth Engine functionality
- **Dependencies**: Requires `terrapyn` core package
- **Imports**: `from terrapyn.ee import data, io, stats, timeseries, utils`

### BigQuery Module: `terrapyn-bq`
- **Installation**: `pip install terrapyn-bq`
- **Contains**: BigQuery functionality
- **Dependencies**: Requires `terrapyn` core package
- **Imports**: `from terrapyn.bq import data, io`

## Installation Options

### Python environment setup
An environment with Python version `3.10` or later is required. If you don't have this, it can be created using [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) which should be installed first. After installing Pyenv, download and install Python `3.10` using

```bash
pyenv install 3.10
```

If you already have Python version `3.10` or later you can skip this step.

The package can be installed in an existing Python environment via pip:

### Minimal Installation (Core Only)
```bash
pip install terrapyn
```

### With Earth Engine Support
```bash
pip install terrapyn terrapyn-ee
```

### With BigQuery Support
```bash
pip install terrapyn terrapyn-bq
```

### Full Installation
```bash
pip install terrapyn terrapyn-ee terrapyn-bq
```

## From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/colinahill/terrapyn.git && cd terrapyn
```

## Development
This project uses [Astral uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies, which should be installed first. Then the environment is created with `uv venv`.

A `Makefile` contains most/all of the required tools for code quality, testing and publishing. Run `make help` to see available commands.
