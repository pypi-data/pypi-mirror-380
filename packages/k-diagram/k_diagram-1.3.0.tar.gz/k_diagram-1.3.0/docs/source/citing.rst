Citing k-diagram
===================

If you use ``k-diagram`` in your research or work, please consider
citing it. Proper citation acknowledges the effort involved in
developing and maintaining the software and helps others find and
verify the tools you used.

We recommend citing the software paper (JOSS) **and** the software
package itself. You may also cite any related application or methods
papers that informed your work.

Software Paper (Planned JOSS Submission)
----------------------------------------

This paper focuses on the ``k-diagram`` software and is intended for
the open-source and scientific software community.

Citing the Software Package
---------------------------

If you wish to cite the software artifact directly, include the
author, title, version used, and repository URL.

**Recommended format:**

.. note::
   
   Replace ``|release|`` with the specific version you used. You can
   check the installed version with ``k-diagram --version`` or
   ``import kdiagram; print(kdiagram.__version__)``.)

   Furthermore, we plan to archive stable releases on Zenodo to provide a persistent
   DOI. Please check the repository for updates once DOIs are issued.
