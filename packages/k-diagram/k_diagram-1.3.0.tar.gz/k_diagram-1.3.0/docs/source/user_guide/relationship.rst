Visualizing Relationships
=============================

Understanding the relationship between observed (true) values and model
predictions is fundamental to evaluation (see :footcite:t:`Murphy1993What, Jolliffe2012`).
While standard scatter plots are common, visualizing this relationship in a polar
context can sometimes reveal different patterns or allow for comparing multiple
prediction series against the true values in a compact format (see also the wider
discussion on calibration and sharpness in probabilistic evaluation
:footcite:p:`Gneiting2007b`).

`k-diagram` provides the ``plot_relationship`` function to explore these
connections using a flexible polar scatter plot where the angle is
derived from the true values and the radius from the predicted values
:footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`.

Summary of Relationship Functions
---------------------------------

This section focuses on functions for visualizing the relationships
between the core components of a forecast: true values, model
predictions, and forecast errors.

Detailed Explanations
---------------------

Let's dive into the :mod:`kdiagram.plot.relationship` function.

.. _ug_plot_relationship:

True vs. Predicted Polar Relationship (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_relationship`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function generates a polar scatter plot designed to visualize the
relationship between a single set of true (observed) values and one or
more sets of corresponding predicted values. It maps the true values to
the angular position and the predicted values (normalized) to the radial
position, allowing comparison of how different predictions behave across
the range of true values :footcite:p:`kouadiob2025` ( see foundational ideas
on forecast evaluation and reliability :footcite:p:`Murphy1993What, Jolliffe2012`).

**Mathematical Concept:**

1.  **Angular Mapping** ( :math:`\theta` ): Let's consider :math:`\upsilon` as 
    the ``angular_angle``. The angle :math:`\theta_i` for each
    data point :math:`i` is determined by its corresponding true value 
    :math:`y_{\text{true}_i}` based on the ``theta_scale`` parameter:
    
    * ``'proportional'`` (Default): Linearly maps the range of
      `y_true` values to the specified angular coverage (`acov`).
        
      .. math::
          \theta_i = \theta_{offset} + \upsilon \cdot
          \frac{y_{\text{true}_i} - \min(y_{\text{true}})}
          {\max(y_{\text{true}}) - \min(y_{\text{true}})}
            
    * ``'uniform'``: Distributes points evenly across the angular
      range based on their index :math:`i`, ignoring the actual
      `y_true` value for positioning (useful if `y_true` isn't
      strictly ordered or continuous).
        
      .. math::
          \theta_i = \theta_{offset} + \upsilon \cdot
          \frac{i}{N-1}

    Where :math:`\upsilon` is determined by `acov` (e.g., :math:`2\pi`
    for 'default', :math:`\pi` for 'half_circle') and :math:`\theta_{offset}`
    is an optional rotation.

2.  **Radial Mapping** :math:`r`: For *each* prediction series `y_pred`, its
    values are independently normalized to the range [0, 1] using min-max
    scaling. This normalized value determines the radius :math:`r_i` for
    that prediction series at angle :math:`\theta_i`.
    
    .. math::
        r_i = \frac{y_{\text{pred}_i} - \min(y_{\text{pred}})}
        {\max(y_{\text{pred}}) - \min(y_{\text{pred}})}

3.  **Custom Angle Labels** :math:`z_{values}`: If :math:`z_{values}` are provided,
    the angular tick labels are replaced with these values (scaled to
    match the angular range), providing a way to label the angular axis
    with a variable other than the raw `y_true` values used for positioning.

**Interpretation:**

* **Angle:** Represents the position within the range of `y_true` values
  (if `theta_scale='proportional'`) or simply the sample index (if
  `theta_scale='uniform'`). If `z_values` are used, the tick labels
  refer to that variable.
* **Radius:** Represents the **normalized** predicted value for a specific
  model/series. A radius near 1 means the prediction was close to the
  *maximum prediction* made by *that specific model*. A radius near 0
  means it was close to the *minimum prediction* made by *that model*.
* **Comparing Models:** Look at points with similar angles (i.e., similar
  `y_true` values). Compare the radial positions of points from
  different models (different colors). Does one model consistently
  predict higher *normalized* values than another at certain `y_true`
  ranges (angles)?
* **Relationship Pattern:** Observe the overall pattern. Does the radius
  (normalized prediction) tend to increase as the angle (`y_true`)
  increases? Is the relationship linear, cyclical, or scattered? How
  does the pattern differ between models?

**Use Cases:**

* Comparing the *relative* response patterns of multiple models across
  the observed range of true values, especially when absolute scales
  differ.
* Visualizing potential non-linear relationships between true values
  (angle) and normalized predictions (radius).
* Exploring data using alternative angular representations by providing
  custom labels via `z_values`.
* Displaying cyclical relationships if `y_true` represents a cyclical
  variable (e.g., day of year, hour of day) and `acov='default'`.

**Advantages (Polar Context):**

* Can effectively highlight cyclical patterns when `y_true` is mapped
  proportionally to a full circle (`acov='default'`).
* Allows overlaying multiple normalized prediction series against a
  common angular axis derived from the true values.
* Flexible angular labeling using `z_values` provides context beyond the
  raw `y_true` mapping.
* Normalization focuses the comparison on response *patterns* rather than
  absolute prediction magnitudes.

Understanding the direct relationship between a model's predictions
and the true values is a cornerstone of regression diagnostics. This
polar scatter plot offers a unique perspective on this relationship,
mapping true values to the angle and normalized predictions to the
radius, which is especially useful for comparing the response patterns
of multiple models.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   An environmental agency uses two different scientific models to
   predict water temperature in a river based on air temperature.
   "Model A" is a simple linear model, while "Model B" is a more
   complex non-linear model. The agency needs to understand if and
   how their prediction patterns differ across the full range of
   observed water temperatures.

   This plot will map the true water temperature to the angle on a
   circle and the models' normalized predictions to the radius. This
   allows us to see if, for instance, one model systematically
   under-predicts at high temperatures.

      :alt: A polar scatter plot showing the true vs. predicted relationship.

      A polar scatter plot comparing the response patterns of a
      linear and a non-linear model across the range of true values.

   This plot visualizes the core stimulus-response behavior of each
   model. By tracing the points around the circle, we can diagnose how
   each model's predictions change as the real-world value increases.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot effectively contrasts the response patterns of the two
    models. "Model A (Linear)" produces points that form a tight,
    consistent spiral, visually confirming that its normalized
    predictions increase in a stable, linear fashion with the true
    water temperature. In contrast, the points for "Model B
    (Non-Linear)" are more scattered and follow a different pattern. Its
    normalized predictions appear to level off at higher temperatures
    (larger angles), clearly distinguishing its non-linear behavior
    from the simpler linear model.

behaviors of different models. To see the full implementation, please

.. _ug_plot_conditional_quantiles:

Conditional Quantile Bands (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_conditional_quantiles`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Conditional Quantile Plot** to
visualize how the entire predicted conditional distribution
(represented by quantile bands) changes as a function of the true
observed value. It is a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying
**heteroscedasticity**—i.e., whether the forecast uncertainty is
constant or changes with the magnitude of the target variable.

**Mathematical Concept:**
This plot provides an intuitive view of the conditional predictive
distribution, a novel visualization developed as part of the
analytics framework:footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`.

1.  **Coordinate Mapping**: The function first sorts the data based
    on the true values, :math:`y_{true}`, to ensure a continuous
    spiral. The sorted true values are then mapped to the
    angular coordinate, :math:`\theta`, in the range :math:`[0, 2\pi]`.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:angle_map_cond_q

       \theta_i \propto y_{true,i}^{\text{(sorted)}}

    The predicted quantiles, :math:`q_{i, \tau}`, for each
    observation :math:`i` and quantile level :math:`\tau` are
    mapped directly to the radial coordinate, :math:`r`.

2.  **Band Construction**: For a given prediction interval (e.g.,
    80%), the corresponding lower (:math:`\tau=0.1`) and
    upper (:math:`\tau=0.9`) quantile forecasts are used to
    define the boundaries of a shaded band. The function can
    plot multiple, nested bands to give a more complete picture
    of the distribution's shape. The median forecast
    (:math:`\tau=0.5`) is drawn as a solid central line.


**Interpretation:**
The plot reveals how the forecast distribution's center and spread
are related to the true value on the angular axis.

* **Central Line (Median Forecast)**: The position of this line
  shows the central tendency of the forecast. If it consistently
  deviates from a perfect spiral, it may indicate a conditional
  bias.
* **Shaded Bands (Prediction Intervals)**: The **width** of these
  bands is the most important feature.
    
  - If the band has a **constant width** as the angle increases,
    the model's uncertainty is **homoscedastic** (constant).
  - If the band's width **changes** (e.g., gets wider), the
    model's uncertainty is **heteroscedastic**, meaning the
    forecast precision depends on the magnitude of the true value.

**Use Cases:**

* To diagnose if a model's uncertainty is constant or if it
  changes with the magnitude of the target variable.
* To visually inspect the full predicted distribution, not just a
  point estimate, across the range of outcomes.
* To identify if a model is consistently over- or under-confident
  for specific ranges of the true value by observing the band widths.

For probabilistic forecasts, it is not enough to know that a model's
uncertainty is well-calibrated on average; we must also check if that
uncertainty changes depending on the outcome. This is the problem of
**heteroscedasticity**, and the conditional quantile plot is the ideal
tool for diagnosing it.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   An insurance company has built a model to predict the final cost of
   a claim. For small, routine claims, the final cost is usually very
   predictable. However, for large, complex claims, the potential
   payout is much more uncertain. The company needs a model that
   reflects this reality by producing wider prediction intervals for
   higher-value claims.

   This plot will visualize the model's full predicted distribution
   (as quantile bands) as a function of the true claim cost. A good
   model should show the bands getting wider as the cost increases.

   .. code-block:: pycon

      >>> import numpy as np
      >>> import kdiagram as kd
      >>>
      >>> # --- 1. Simulate heteroscedastic insurance claim data ---
      >>> np.random.seed(42)
      >>> n_points = 250
      >>> # True claim costs (low to high)
      >>> y_true = np.linspace(100, 5000, n_points)
      >>> # Uncertainty (noise) increases with the claim size
      >>> error_std = y_true * 0.2
      >>> quantiles = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9])
      >>> y_preds_quantiles = np.quantile(
      ...     y_true[:, np.newaxis] + np.random.normal(0, error_std[:, np.newaxis], (n_points, 500)),
      ...     q=quantiles,
      ...     axis=1
      ... ).T

      :alt: A polar plot of conditional quantile bands.

      A polar plot where the angle represents the true value and the
      radius shows the predicted distribution, revealing how
      uncertainty changes with the outcome.

   This plot provides an intuitive visualization of the model's
   situational confidence. By observing the width of the shaded bands
   as they spiral outwards, we can assess if the model is correctly
   adjusting its uncertainty estimates.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot provides a clear visualization of the model's conditional
    uncertainty. The most critical insight is that the **width of the
    shaded prediction intervals is not constant**. The 50% (yellow-green)
    and 80% (light blue) intervals are very narrow for low-cost claims
    (near the center) and become progressively wider as the true claim
    cost increases (spiraling outwards). This demonstrates that the model
    has successfully learned to be **heteroscedastic**, correctly
    producing wider, less certain predictions for large, volatile claims
    and sharper, more confident predictions for smaller ones.

Diagnosing this kind of conditional behavior is key to building
sophisticated and trustworthy forecasting models. To explore this
example in more detail, please visit the gallery.

.. _ug_plot_error_relationship:

Error vs. True Value Relationship (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_error_relationship`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**
This function creates a **Polar Error vs. True Value Plot**, a
powerful diagnostic tool for understanding if a model's errors are
correlated with the magnitude of the actual outcome. The angle is
proportional to the **true value**, and the radius represents the
**forecast error**. It is designed to reveal conditional biases and
heteroscedasticity.


**Mathematical Concept:**
This plot is a novel visualization developed as part of the
analytics framework in :footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`. It helps
diagnose if the model's error is independent of the true value,
a key assumption in many statistical models.

1.  **Error (Residual) Calculation**: For each observation
    :math:`i`, the error is the difference between the true and
    predicted value.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:error_calc_true

       e_i = y_{true,i} - y_{pred,i}

2.  **Angular Mapping**: The angle :math:`\theta_i` is made
    proportional to the true value :math:`y_{true,i}`,
    after sorting, to create a continuous spiral.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:angle_map_true

       \theta_i \propto y_{true,i}^{\text{(sorted)}}

3.  **Radial Mapping**: The radius :math:`r_i` represents the
    error :math:`e_i`. To handle negative error values on a
    polar plot, an offset is added to all radii so that the
    zero-error line becomes a reference circle.


**Interpretation:**
The plot reveals how the error distribution changes as the true
value increases.

* **Conditional Bias**: A well-behaved model should have its
  error points scattered symmetrically around the "Zero Error"
  circle at all angles. If the center of the point cloud
  consistently drifts away from this circle at certain angles,
  it reveals a **conditional bias** (e.g., the model only
  under-predicts high values).
* **Heteroscedasticity**: The vertical spread of the points
  (the width of the spiral) shows the error variance. If this
  spread changes as the angle increases, it indicates
  **heteroscedasticity** (i.e., the model is more or less
  certain for different true values).

**Use Cases:**

* To check the fundamental assumption in many models that errors
  are independent of the true value.
* To diagnose if a model has a conditional bias (e.g., it only
  performs poorly for high or low values).
* To visually inspect for heteroscedasticity, where the variance
  of the error changes across the range of true values.

A fundamental assumption of many regression models is that the errors
are independent of the value being predicted. A model is not truly
reliable if it only performs well on a subset of the data. This plot
is a crucial diagnostic for testing that assumption by visualizing the
relationship between the forecast error and the true, observed value.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   A real estate agency uses a machine learning model to predict house
   prices. For the model to be fair and useful, it must be accurate
   across the entire price range, from starter homes to luxury estates.
   A common failure mode is for models to systematically under-predict
   the prices of very expensive homes.

   This plot maps the true house price to the angle and the prediction
   error to the radius. It will immediately reveal if the model's
   errors are correlated with the actual value of the property.

      A polar scatter plot where the angle represents the true house
      price and the radius represents the prediction error, used to
      diagnose conditional bias.

   This plot creates a spiral of error points. In a well-behaved
   model, this spiral should be centered on the "Zero Error" circle at
   all angles. Let's see if our model exhibits any problematic drifts.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    In this diagnostic plot, a well-behaved model should have its error
    points scattered randomly and symmetrically around the dashed "Zero
    Error" circle across all angles. The visualization confirms this
    ideal behavior. The points are spread evenly around the reference
    circle throughout the entire range of true house prices. This provides
    strong evidence that the model does **not** suffer from conditional
    bias, meaning its accuracy is consistent regardless of whether it is
    predicting a low-price or high-price property.

and robust regression models. To see the full implementation of this

.. _ug_plot_residual_relationship:

Residual vs. Predicted Relationship (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_residual_relationship`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Residual vs. Predicted Plot**, a
fundamental diagnostic for assessing model performance. The angle is
proportional to the **predicted value**, and the radius represents
the **forecast error** (residual). It is a powerful tool for
identifying if a model's errors are correlated with its own
predictions, which can reveal issues like heteroscedasticity.

.. admonition:: Key Distinction: Error vs. Residual Plots
   :class: hint

   This plot is a companion to
   :func:`~kdiagram.plot.relationship.plot_error_relationship`.
   The key difference is the variable mapped to the angle:

   - **Error vs. True Value Plot**: Angle is based on ``y_true``. It
     answers: *"Are my errors related to the actual outcome?"*
   - **Residual vs. Predicted Plot**: Angle is based on ``y_pred``. It
     answers: *"Are my errors related to what my model is predicting?"*

   Both are crucial for a complete diagnosis.

**Mathematical Concep:t**
This plot is a novel visualization developed as part of the
analytics framework in :footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`.

1.  **Error (Residual) Calculation**: For each observation
    :math:`i`, the error is the difference between the true and
    predicted value.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:residual_calc

       e_i = y_{true,i} - y_{pred,i}

2.  **Angular Mapping**: The angle :math:`\theta_i` is made
    proportional to the **predicted value** :math:`y_{pred,i}`,
    after sorting, to create a continuous spiral.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:angle_map_pred

       \theta_i \propto y_{pred,i}^{\text{(sorted)}}

3.  **Radial Mapping**: The radius :math:`r_i` represents the
    error :math:`e_i`. An offset is added to handle negative
    values, making the "Zero Error" line a reference circle.


**Interpretation:**
The plot reveals how the error distribution changes as the
model's own prediction magnitude increases.

* **Heteroscedasticity**: A well-behaved model should have a
  random scatter of points with a constant vertical spread
  (width of the spiral). If the spread of points forms a
  **cone or fan shape**, getting wider as the angle increases,
  it is a clear sign of **heteroscedasticity**. This means the
  model's error variance grows as its predictions get larger.
* **Conditional Bias**: If the center of the point cloud
  consistently drifts away from the "Zero Error" circle at
  certain angles, it reveals a bias dependent on the
  prediction's magnitude (e.g., the model is only biased when
  it predicts high values).


**Use Cases:**

* To check the assumption that the variance of the model's errors
  is constant across the range of its predictions.
* To diagnose if a model is becoming more or less confident in
  itself as its predictions change.
* To identify non-linear patterns in the residuals that might
  suggest a missing feature or an incorrect model specification.

After checking for errors against the true value, a complementary and
equally critical diagnostic is to plot the residuals against the
**predicted value**. This is the classic test for **heteroscedasticity**,
which answers the question: *"Does my model's error variance change as
its predictions get larger?"* A good model should have consistent
error variance across its entire range of predictions.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Let's continue with our house price prediction model. The real
   estate agency now wants to check if the model's confidence is
   constant. Is it equally certain when predicting a \\$200k house as
   it is when predicting a \\$2M house? If the model's errors become
   much larger for higher-priced predictions, its reliability is questionable.

   This plot maps the predicted price to the angle and the error to
   the radius. A "fanning out" or cone shape in the points is a tell-tale
   sign of heteroscedasticity.

      A polar scatter plot where the angle represents the predicted
      house price and the radius represents the prediction error,
      used to diagnose heteroscedasticity.

   This plot should show a random scatter of points centered on the
   "Zero Error" circle. Any systematic patterns, such as a change in
   the spread of the points, indicate a problem with the model.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot reveals a crucial characteristic of the model's error
    structure. While the errors are centered on the "Zero Error" line,
    their spread is not constant. The points are tightly clustered for
    low predicted values (small angles) but fan out significantly as the
    predicted house price increases (larger angles). This distinct **cone
    shape** is the classic signature of **heteroscedasticity**. It
    indicates that the model's error variance grows with the magnitude of
    its predictions; in other words, the model is much less certain and
    makes larger errors when it predicts high property values.

Checking for heteroscedasticity is fundamental to regression
diagnostics. To explore this example in more detail, please visit the
