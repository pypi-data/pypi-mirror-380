Case Study: Zhongshan Land Subsidence Uncertainty
====================================================

.. admonition:: Context: Forecasting in Complex Urban Environments
   :class: hint

   Urban areas, particularly coastal and delta regions like Zhongshan
   in China's Pearl River Delta, face significant challenges from
   land subsidence. This gradual sinking, driven by complex interactions
   between groundwater extraction, geological conditions, infrastructure
   load, and climate factors, poses risks to buildings, flood control,
   and sustainable development. Accurately forecasting future
   subsidence is crucial for effective urban planning and hazard
   mitigation, but requires not only predicting the most likely outcome
   but also understanding the associated **predictive uncertainty**
   (:footcite:t:`Liu2024`).

This case study demonstrates how various visualization tools within the
``k-diagram`` package can be applied to analyze and interpret the
outputs of a land subsidence forecasting model, using a sample dataset
derived from research focused on the Zhongshan area (:footcite:t:`kouadiob2025`).
We will explore how different polar plots help reveal patterns in uncertainty,
model performance, and potential prediction anomalies.

.. note::
   The dataset used in this case study (``min_zhongshan.csv``, accessed
   via :func:`~kdiagram.datasets.load_zhongshan_subsidence`) is a
   **sample** derived from larger research model outputs. It is
   provided for **educational and demonstration purposes only** to
   illustrate the use of `k-diagram` functions. It does not represent
   the complete, validated forecast results for the region.


The Zhongshan Sample Dataset
------------------------------

The dataset included with `k-diagram` provides a snapshot of predicted
subsidence uncertainty for 898 locations over multiple years.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Spatial Coordinates:** Includes ``longitude`` and ``latitude`` for
  each location.
* **Target Values:** Contains columns ``subsidence_2022`` and
  ``subsidence_2023`` representing reference or baseline subsidence
  values for those years (useful for some diagnostics like coverage).
* **Quantile Forecasts:** Provides predicted quantiles (Q10, Q50, Q90)
  for the years 2022 through 2026 (e.g., ``subsidence_2024_q0.1``,
  ``subsidence_2024_q0.5``, ``subsidence_2024_q0.9``). This allows
  analysis of uncertainty intervals and their evolution over time.

**Loading the Data:**

You can easily load this data using the provided function. By default,
it returns a Bunch object containing the DataFrame and useful metadata:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import warnings

   # Ignore potential download/cache warnings for brevity
   warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message=".*already exists.*")

   # Load data as Bunch (default)
   try:
       zhongshan_data = kd.datasets.load_zhongshan_subsidence(
           download_if_missing=True # Allow download if not found
       )
       print("Zhongshan data loaded successfully.")
       print(f"DataFrame shape: {zhongshan_data.frame.shape}")
       print("\nAvailable Columns (Sample):")
       print(zhongshan_data.frame.columns[:10].tolist(), "...") # Show some columns
       # print(zhongshan_data.DESCR) # Uncomment to see full description
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("Zhongshan dataset not found. Ensure k-diagram is installed"
             " correctly with data, or check internet connection.")

.. code-block:: text
   :caption: Example Output

Loading Zhongshan Data for Interval Consistency Plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example demonstrates loading the packaged Zhongshan dataset using
:func:`~kdiagram.datasets.load_zhongshan_subsidence` (as a Bunch object)
and analyzing the temporal consistency of its prediction interval widths
using :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_consistency`. Includes
basic error handling in case the data cannot be loaded.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   import kdiagram as kd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import warnings
   import pandas as pd # Used by the function internally

   # Suppress potential download warnings if data exists locally
   warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message=".*already exists.*")

   ax = None # Initialize ax
   try:
       # 1. Load data as Bunch, allow download if missing
       data = kd.datasets.load_zhongshan_subsidence(
           as_frame=False,
           download_if_missing=True,

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot uses
   :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_consistency`
   to assess the stability of the predicted uncertainty range
   (Q90-Q10 interval width) over time (2022-2026) for the
   Zhongshan sample dataset. The plot is restricted to a 45-degree
   angular sector (``acov='eighth_circle'``).

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents a subset of the location indices (0-897)
     mapped onto a 45-degree arc. Labels are masked.
   * **Radius (r):** Shows the **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** of the
     interval width (Q90-Q10) calculated across the years 2022-2026
     for each location. A higher radius indicates greater *relative*
     variability in the predicted uncertainty width over time for
     that location.
   * **Color:** Represents the **average Q50** (median subsidence
     prediction) across all years for each location, using the
     `plasma` colormap (purple=low, yellow=high). The color bar
     indicates the scale.

   **🔍 Key Insights from this Example:**

   * **High General Consistency:** The vast majority of points are
     clustered very close to the center (radius near 0), indicating
     a very **low CV**. This suggests that for most locations in this
     sample and view, the *width* of the predicted uncertainty interval
     is relatively **stable and consistent** across the forecast
     horizon (2022-2026).
   * **Outliers:** A few distinct points have a significantly larger
     radius (CV > 40). These represent locations where the predicted
     interval width fluctuates dramatically over the years relative
     to its average width, signaling **highly inconsistent** or
     unstable uncertainty predictions.
   * **Color Context:** The dense cluster of consistent points (low CV)
     mainly shows purple and dark blue colors, corresponding to lower
     average Q50 predictions. The few highly inconsistent points
     (high CV outliers) show a mix of colors, suggesting instability
     can occur at different average subsidence levels in this dataset.

   **💡 Use Case Connection:**

   * This plot helps identify specific locations (the outliers) where
     the model's uncertainty predictions are unreliable over time,
     warranting further investigation.
   * The general consistency for most points (low CV cluster) might
     increase confidence in the stability of uncertainty estimates
     for those areas, potentially aiding risk assessment where the
     average predicted subsidence (color) is also low.

Loading Zhongshan Data for Coverage Diagnostic (Specific Year)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example loads the Zhongshan dataset, subsets it to a specific
year (2023) and relevant quantiles (Q10, Q90) during the load step,
and then uses :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage_diagnostic`
to visualize point-wise coverage for that year.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot uses
   :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_coverage_diagnostic`
   to assess the point-wise coverage of the Q10-Q90 prediction
   interval against the target ``subsidence_2023`` values from the
   Zhongshan sample dataset for the year 2023.

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the index (0-897) of each specific
     location in the Zhongshan dataset, mapped around the circle.
   * **Radius (r):** Indicates coverage: **1** if the actual 2023
     subsidence value was within the predicted [Q10, Q90] interval
     for that location; **0** if it was outside.
   * **Points:** Scatter points (``as_bars=False``) are used. The
     vast majority appear clustered at radius 1 (greenish points).
     Points at radius 0 (uncovered) are difficult to discern visually
     in this rendering, possibly due to overlap or marker style.
   * **Average Coverage Line:** The solid **red line** forms a circle
     at a radius corresponding to the **overall coverage rate**,
     explicitly labeled in the legend as **0.55 (or 55%)**.
   * **Gradient Fill:** The green shaded area extends from the center
     only up to the average coverage radius (0.55).

   **🔍 Key Insights from this Example:**

   * **Significant Under-coverage:** The most striking feature is the
     **low average coverage rate of 55%** (indicated by the red line
     and legend), despite using a nominal 80% prediction interval
     (Q10-Q90). This suggests the model's prediction intervals for
     2023 were, on average, **too narrow** and failed to capture the
     true subsidence value almost half the time for this dataset.
   * **Visual vs. Average Discrepancy:** While visually most *plotted*
     points seem to indicate success (radius 1), the calculated
     average (55%) reveals that a substantial number of points must
     be at radius 0 (uncovered), even if not clearly visible. This
     highlights the importance of the calculated average line as a
     reliable summary statistic.
   * **Potential Issues:** The low coverage rate indicates potential
     issues with the model's uncertainty calibration for the 2023
     forecast period in the original study this sample data is
     derived from.

   **💡 When to Use:**

   * Use this plot to verify if the prediction intervals for a
     *specific time period* achieve the desired nominal coverage.
   * Identify if coverage failures are widespread (as suggested by the
     low average here) or specific to certain samples (which would
     require examining the points near radius 0 more closely, perhaps
     with different marker styles or alpha settings).
   * Assess the practical reliability of the forecast's uncertainty
     bounds for decision-making in a given period.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot, generated by
   :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_velocity`, visualizes the
   **average rate of change (velocity)** of the median (Q50)
   subsidence predictions across the available years (likely 2022-2026)
   for each location in the Zhongshan sample dataset.

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents the index (0-897) of each location,
     distributed around the full 360 degrees (``acov='default'``).
     Angular labels are hidden (``mask_angle=True``).
   * **Radius (r):** Shows the **normalized average velocity**, scaled
     to [0, 1] (due to ``normalize=True``). A radius near 1 indicates
     locations where the Q50 prediction changed most rapidly on average
     over the years; a radius near 0 indicates very stable Q50
     predictions.
   * **Color:** Represents the **average absolute Q50 magnitude** across
     all years for each location (since ``use_abs_color=True``). The
     ``jet_r`` colormap is used (blue=low magnitude, red=high
     magnitude), with the scale shown on the color bar.
   * **Marker Size/Alpha:** Larger markers (``s=80``) with some
     transparency (``alpha=0.8``) are used.

   **🔍 Key Insights from this Example:**

   * **Velocity Distribution:** There is a considerable spread in
     velocities. While many locations show low to moderate normalized
     velocity (points clustered r < 0.5), a noticeable number exhibit
     higher velocities (points with r > 0.6), indicating significant
     variation in the predicted rate of subsidence change across locations.
   * **Velocity vs. Magnitude:** Visually, there appears to be some
     correlation between velocity and magnitude. Locations with higher
     average Q50 magnitude (yellow/orange/red points) seem more
     prevalent at larger radii (higher velocity) compared to locations
     with lower average Q50 (blue/cyan points), which are more
     concentrated near the center (lower velocity). This suggests areas
     predicted to have higher subsidence might also be predicted to
     change more rapidly.
   * **Spatial Pattern:** Without angular labels tied to actual spatial
     coordinates, identifying precise geographical patterns is hard, but
     the overall distribution appears somewhat uniform angularly, without
     extreme clustering in specific index ranges.

   **💡 Use Case Connection:**

   * This plot helps identify locations within the Zhongshan sample
     predicted to undergo the fastest *average* rate of change in
     subsidence over the forecast period (points furthest from center).
   * By coloring by average Q50 magnitude, it allows planners to see
     if these high-velocity areas are also areas of high absolute
     subsidence risk, potentially requiring priority attention.

   This plot uses
   :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_interval_width` to display
   the **magnitude of the predicted uncertainty** (interval width)
   for the year **2022** in the Zhongshan sample dataset. The view
   is restricted to a 45-degree sector (``acov='eighth_circle'``).

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents a subset of the location indices
     mapped onto the 45-degree arc. Angular labels are hidden.
   * **Radius (r):** Directly shows the **raw interval width**
     calculated as ``subsidence_2022_q90 - subsidence_2022_q10``
     for each plotted location. Larger radius indicates greater
     predicted uncertainty magnitude for 2022.
   * **Color:** Represents the **median prediction** value
     (``subsidence_2022_q50``) for each location, using the
     `YlGnBu` colormap (light yellow/green = low Q50, dark blue =
     high Q50), indicated by the color bar.

   **🔍 Key Insights from this Example:**

   * **Width Distribution:** For the locations visible in this narrow
     sector, most prediction intervals in 2022 have widths ranging
     roughly from 0 to 40 units.
   * **Width vs. Magnitude:** Within the main cluster, there isn't an
     immediately obvious strong correlation between interval width
     (radius) and the median prediction Q50 (color) – various widths
     appear across different Q50 levels.
   * **Outliers & Potential Data Issues:** Several points exhibit
     very large positive radii (high uncertainty), and notably, some
     points have **negative radii** (plotted below the center).
     Negative radii imply that for those specific locations in the
     2022 data sample, the recorded Q10 value was *greater* than the
     Q90 value, which indicates either a data error or a severe model
     prediction failure for those points.

   **💡 When to Use / Connection:**

   * Use this plot to directly visualize the predicted uncertainty
     magnitude (interval width) for each sample at a *single point
     in time*.
   * The color mapping (`z_col`) helps investigate relationships
     between uncertainty width and the central tendency (Q50) or
     other features.
   * Identifying outliers with extremely large or physically
     implausible (negative) widths is crucial for model diagnostics
     and data quality checks. These specific locations from the
     Zhongshan sample would require further investigation in a real
     analysis.
   * Using narrower `acov` settings like `eighth_circle` can help
     focus on specific subsets if the angular arrangement is meaningful,
     but limits the overall view.

.. topic:: 🧠 Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This plot uses
   :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_uncertainty_drift` to
   visualize how the pattern of predicted uncertainty (relative
   interval width Q90-Q10) evolves over multiple years (2022-2026)
   for the Zhongshan sample dataset. The view is focused on a
   90-degree sector (``acov='quarter_circle'``).

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Angle (θ):** Represents a subset of the location indices
     (0-897) mapped onto the 90-degree arc. Angular labels are
     hidden (``mask_angle=True``).
   * **Concentric Rings:** Each ring represents a specific year, as
     indicated by the legend (2022 is innermost, 2026 is outermost).
     The colors should ideally follow the `viridis` colormap, though
     in the rendered example they appear uniformly purple; the legend
     remains key for identification.
   * **Radius (r) on Ring:** The radial position of the line for a
     given year and angle indicates the **relative interval width**
     (Q90-Q10, normalized across all years and locations) plus a
     base offset specific to that year's ring. Larger radii on a ring
     correspond to locations with relatively higher uncertainty in
     that year.

   **🔍 Key Insights from this Example:**

   * **Temporal Drift:** By visually comparing the average radial
     position of the rings, we can observe a slight tendency for the
     outer rings (later years like 2025, 2026) to be positioned
     further from the center than the inner rings (earlier years like
     2022, 2023). This suggests a **mild positive drift** – on average,
     the relative uncertainty tends to increase over the forecast
     horizon for the locations shown in this quadrant.
   * **Spatial Variability:** Each individual ring (year) exhibits
     significant "spikiness" or irregularity. This indicates **high
     spatial variability** in predicted uncertainty *within* each year;
     some locations (angles) consistently have much wider or narrower
     relative intervals than others.
   * **Pattern Consistency:** While the average radius drifts slightly,
     the *degree* of irregularity or "bumpiness" looks somewhat
     similar across the different years within this view. This might
     suggest that while overall uncertainty increases, the spatial
     *pattern* of high/low uncertainty locations remains relatively
     consistent over time.

   **💡 When to Use / Connection:**

   * Use this plot to understand how the **entire spatial pattern**
     (represented by angle) of uncertainty changes from one time
     period to the next.
   * Compare it with :func:`~kdiagram.plot.uncertainty.plot_model_drift`.
     While `plot_model_drift` shows the *average* drift across all
     locations, this plot reveals if that drift is uniform or if
     certain locations experience much larger increases in uncertainty
     than others.
   * The restricted view (``quarter_circle``) focuses the analysis
     but only shows a fraction of the locations.
