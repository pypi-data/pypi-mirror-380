Evaluating Classification Models
====================================

Evaluating the performance of classification models is a crucial
step in the machine learning workflow. Beyond a single accuracy
score, a thorough evaluation requires understanding a model's
ability to distinguish between classes, its performance on
imbalanced data, and its specific types of errors.

The :mod:`kdiagram.plot.evaluation` module provides a suite of
visualizations for this purpose, featuring novel polar adaptations
of standard, powerful diagnostic tools like the ROC curve, the
Precision-Recall curve, and the confusion matrix. These plots
provide an intuitive and aesthetically engaging way to compare
the performance of multiple models and diagnose their strengths
and weaknesses.

Polar ROC Curve (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.evaluation.plot_polar_roc`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) Curve**, a novel visualization for evaluating the performance
of binary classification models. It adapts the standard ROC curve,
a fundamental tool in machine learning, to a more intuitive and
aesthetically engaging polar format :footcite:p:`scikit-learn`.

**Mathematical Concept:**
A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a standard
tool for evaluating binary classifiers :footcite:p:`Powers2011`.
It is created by plotting the **True Positive Rate (TPR)** against
the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** at various threshold settings.

.. math::
   :label: eq:tpr_fpr

   \text{TPR} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \quad , \quad
   \text{FPR} = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}

The novelty of this plot, developed as part of the analytics
framework in :footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`, lies in its
transformation of these Cartesian coordinates into a polar system.
The mapping is defined as:

.. math::
   :label: eq:roc_polar_transform

   \begin{aligned}
     \theta &= \text{FPR} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \\
     r &= \text{TPR}
   \end{aligned}

This transformation maps the standard ROC space onto a 90-degree
polar quadrant:

- The **angle (θ)** is mapped to the False Positive Rate,
  spanning from 0 at 0° to 1 at 90°.
- The **radius (r)** is mapped to the True Positive Rate,
  spanning from 0 at the center to 1 at the edge.

Under this transformation, the standard y=x "no-skill" line becomes
a perfect Archimedean spiral.

**Interpretation:**
The plot provides an intuitive visual assessment of a classifier's
discriminative power.

* **No-Skill Spiral (Dashed Line)**: This is the polar equivalent
  of the y=x diagonal in a standard ROC plot. A model with no
  discriminative power would lie on this line.
* **Model Curve**: Each colored line represents a model. A better
  model will have a curve that bows outwards, away from the
  no-skill spiral, maximizing the area under the curve (AUC).
* **Performance**: A model is superior if its curve achieves a
  high True Positive Rate (large radius) for a low False
  Positive Rate (small angle).

**Use Cases:**

* To evaluate and compare the overall discriminative power of
  binary classification models.
* To select an optimal classification threshold based on the
  desired balance between the True Positive Rate and False
  Positive Rate.
* To create a more visually engaging and compact representation of
  ROC performance for reports and presentations.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a cornerstone of
classifier evaluation. While the traditional Cartesian plot is widely
used, this novel polar version offers a more compact and visually
engaging way to compare the discriminative power of different models.
Let's apply it to a critical real-world problem.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Imagine a healthcare provider has developed two machine learning
   models to predict whether a patient has a certain disease based on
   their test results. "Model Alpha" is a well-established algorithm,
   while "Model Beta" is a new, experimental one. It's crucial to
   evaluate which model is better at distinguishing between sick and
   healthy patients.

   The polar ROC curve visualizes this trade-off between correctly
   identifying sick patients (True Positive Rate) and incorrectly
   flagging healthy patients (False Positive Rate).

      A polar ROC plot comparing the performance of "Model Alpha" and
      "Model Beta". A superior model will have a curve that bows
      further outwards from the "no-skill" spiral.

   This plot maps the classic ROC analysis onto an intuitive spiral.
   Let's interpret the curves to determine which model offers better
   diagnostic performance.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    The plot indicates that both models are highly effective, as their
    curves bow significantly outwards from the dashed "No-Skill" spiral.
    However, a direct comparison reveals that "Model Beta" (yellow) is
    the superior classifier. Its curve consistently sits outside of
    "Model Alpha's" curve, demonstrating its ability to achieve a
    higher True Positive Rate (radius) for any given False Positive
    Rate (angle). This visual conclusion is quantitatively confirmed by
    Model Beta's higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.98,
    compared to 0.93 for Model Alpha.

This visualization provides a clear verdict on which model has better
discriminative ability. To see the full implementation and dive deeper

.. _ug_plot_polar_pr_curve:

Polar Precision-Recall Curve (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.evaluation.plot_polar_pr_curve`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Precision-Recall (PR) Curve**, a
novel visualization for evaluating binary classification models. It
is particularly useful for tasks with **imbalanced classes** (e.g.,
fraud detection, medical diagnosis), where ROC curves can sometimes
provide an overly optimistic view of performance.


**Mathematical Concept:**
A Precision-Recall curve is a standard tool for evaluating binary
classifiers :footcite:p:`Powers2011`. It is created by plotting
**Precision** against **Recall** at various threshold settings.

.. math::
   :label: eq:pr_curve

   \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \quad , \quad
   \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}

The novelty of this plot, developed as part of the analytics
framework in :footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`, lies in its
transformation of these Cartesian coordinates into a polar system.
The mapping is defined as:

.. math::
   :label: eq:pr_polar_transform

   \begin{aligned}
     \theta &= \text{Recall} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} \\
     r &= \text{Precision}
   \end{aligned}

This transformation maps the standard PR space onto a 90-degree
polar quadrant:

- The **angle (θ)** is mapped to **Recall**, spanning from 0 at
  0° to 1 at 90°.
- The **radius (r)** is mapped to **Precision**, spanning from 0
  at the center to 1 at the edge.

A "no-skill" classifier is represented by a circle at a radius
equal to the proportion of positive samples in the dataset.


**Interpretation:**
The plot provides an intuitive visual assessment of a classifier's
performance on the positive class.

* **No-Skill Circle (Dashed Line)**: Represents a random
  classifier. A good model's curve should be far outside this
  circle.
* **Model Curve**: Each colored line represents a model. A better
  model will have a curve that bows outwards towards the top-right
  of the plot, maximizing the area under the curve (Average
  Precision).
* **Performance**: A model is superior if it maintains a high
  Precision (large radius) as it achieves a high Recall (wide
  angular sweep).


**Use Cases:**

* To evaluate and compare binary classifiers on **imbalanced
  datasets** where the number of negative samples far outweighs
  the positive samples.
* To understand the trade-off between a model's ability to
  correctly identify positive cases (Recall) and its ability to
  avoid false alarms (Precision).
* To compare models based on their Average Precision (AP) score,
  which is summarized by the area under the PR curve.

While ROC curves are excellent, they can be misleading on imbalanced
datasets. For problems like fraud detection, where the event of
interest is rare, the Precision-Recall (PR) curve is the industry
standard. This polar version makes comparing models on these tricky
datasets even more intuitive.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Consider a credit card company building a model to detect
   fraudulent transactions. This is a classic imbalanced data problem:
   over 99% of transactions are legitimate. A model that simply
   predicts "not fraud" every time would have high accuracy but would
   be completely useless.

   The polar Precision-Recall curve is the ideal tool here. It evaluates
   a model's ability to find the few fraudulent cases (Recall) while
   minimizing false alarms that would inconvenience customers (Precision).

   .. code-block:: pycon

      >>> import numpy as np
      >>> import kdiagram as kd
      >>>
      >>> # --- 1. Simulate imbalanced fraud data ---
      >>> np.random.seed(42)
      >>> # Only 2% of transactions are fraudulent
      >>> y_true = np.array([0] * 4900 + [1] * 100)
      >>> # A decent model
      >>> y_pred_A = np.clip(y_true * 0.5 + np.random.power(2, 5000) * 0.4, 0.01, 0.99)
      >>> # A better model that handles imbalance well
      >>> y_pred_B = np.clip(y_true * 0.7 + np.random.power(1.5, 5000) * 0.5, 0.01, 0.99)
      >>>
      >>> # --- 2. Generate the plot ---
      >>> ax = kd.plot_polar_pr_curve(
      ...     y_true,
      ...     y_pred_A,
      ...     y_pred_B,

      A polar PR plot comparing two models on an imbalanced fraud
      dataset. The better model will have a curve further from the
      "no-skill" circle.

   This plot visualizes the critical trade-off between finding fraud and
   avoiding false alarms. The model whose curve is pushed further
   outwards is the superior choice.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot first confirms that we are dealing with a highly
    imbalanced dataset, as indicated by the very low "No-Skill" Average
    Precision (AP) score of 0.02. Against this baseline, both "Model A"
    and "Model B" demonstrate exceptionally strong and, in this case,
    perfect performance. Their curves trace the absolute outer edge of
    the plot, showing that they both maintain a perfect Precision
    (radius of 1.0) across all levels of Recall (the full angular
    sweep). This ideal performance is confirmed by their identical and
    perfect AP scores of 1.00.

For tasks with imbalanced data, the PR curve is essential. To explore
this example in more detail and learn how to apply it to your own
problems, please visit the gallery.

.. _ug_plot_polar_confusion_matrix:

Polar Confusion Matrix (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.evaluation.plot_polar_confusion_matrix`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**
This function creates a **Polar Confusion Matrix**, a novel
visualization for the four key components of a binary confusion
matrix: True Positives (TP), False Positives (FP), True Negatives
(TN), and False Negatives (FN). It provides an intuitive,
at-a-glance summary of a classifier's performance and allows for
the direct comparison of multiple models.


**Mathematical Concept:**
The confusion matrix is a fundamental tool for evaluating a
classifier's performance by summarizing the counts of correct and
incorrect predictions for each class. This plot maps these
four components onto a polar bar chart.

- **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted positive cases.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Negative cases incorrectly predicted as positive (Type I error).
- **True Negatives (TN)**: Correctly predicted negative cases.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Positive cases incorrectly predicted as negative (Type II error).

Each of these four categories is assigned its own angular sector,
and the height (radius) of the bar in that sector represents the
count or proportion of samples in that category.


**Interpretation:**
The plot provides an immediate visual summary of a binary
classifier's strengths and weaknesses.

* **Angle**: Each of the four angular sectors represents a
  component of the confusion matrix.
* **Radius**: The length of each bar represents the **proportion**
  (if normalized) or **count** of samples in that category.
* **Ideal Performance**: A good model will have very **long bars**
  in the "True Positive" and "True Negative" sectors and very
  **short bars** in the "False Positive" and "False Negative"
  sectors.


**Use Cases:**

* To get a quick, visual summary of a binary classifier's
  performance.
* To directly compare the error types (False Positives vs. False
  Negatives) of multiple models.
* To create a more visually engaging and intuitive representation
  of a confusion matrix for reports and presentations.


While ROC and PR curves provide a high-level view of a classifier's
performance across different thresholds, a confusion matrix gives us a
clear, quantitative breakdown of its performance at a single, chosen
threshold. It answers the fundamental question: what specific types of
correct and incorrect decisions is the model making?

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Let's consider a critical real-world problem: building an email
   spam filter. We have two models, an "Aggressive Filter" and a
   "Cautious Filter". We need to understand the trade-offs between them.

   - A **False Positive** (a real email flagged as spam) is a very costly error.
   - A **False Negative** (a spam email reaching the inbox) is annoying but less critical.

   The polar confusion matrix will give us an immediate visual
   comparison of how these two models handle this trade-off.

      >>> y_pred_aggressive = np.copy(y_true)
      >>> y_pred_aggressive[np.random.choice(np.where(y_true==0)[0], 50, replace=False)] = 1
      >>> # Cautious Filter: Misses some spam, but has very low false positives
      >>> y_pred_cautious = np.copy(y_true)
      >>> y_pred_cautious[np.random.choice(np.where(y_true==1)[0], 30, replace=False)] = 0

      A polar bar chart comparing the True Positives, False Positives,
      True Negatives, and False Negatives for two different spam
      filters.

   This plot directly visualizes the counts of correct and incorrect
   decisions for each filter. By comparing the bar lengths in each
   quadrant, we can select the model that best fits our business needs.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot clearly visualizes the fundamental trade-off between the
    two spam filters. The "Aggressive Filter" (purple) is slightly
    better at catching spam (longer "True Positive" bar), but this
    performance comes at a significant cost: a noticeable bar in the
    "False Positive" quadrant, meaning it incorrectly flags legitimate
    emails as spam. In contrast, the "Cautious Filter" (yellow) nearly
    eliminates this critical False Positive error. However, this safety
    means it is more likely to miss some spam, as shown by its slightly
    longer bar in the "False Negative" quadrant. The choice depends on
    the priority: maximizing spam capture or protecting the user's inbox.

Understanding the specific error types is crucial for deploying a
responsible model. To see the full implementation and explore how to

.. _ug_plot_polar_confusion_matrix_in:

Multiclass Polar Confusion Matrix (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.evaluation.plot_polar_confusion_matrix_in`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Grouped Polar Bar Chart** to visualize
the performance of a multiclass classifier. It provides an
intuitive, at-a-glance summary of the confusion matrix by
showing how samples from each true class are distributed among
the predicted classes :footcite:p:`scikit-learn`.


**Mathematical Concept**
This plot is a novel visualization of the standard confusion
matrix, :math:`\mathbf{C}`, a fundamental tool for evaluating a
classifier's performance. Each element :math:`C_{ij}` of the
matrix contains the number of observations known to be in class
:math:`i` but predicted to be in class :math:`j`.

This function maps this matrix to a polar plot:

1.  **Angular Sectors**: The polar axis is divided into :math:`K`
    sectors, where :math:`K` is the number of classes. Each
    sector corresponds to a **true class** :math:`i`.

2.  **Grouped Bars**: Within each sector for true class :math:`i`,
    a set of :math:`K` bars is drawn. The height (radius) of the
    :math:`j`-th bar corresponds to the value of :math:`C_{ij}`,
    representing the count or proportion of samples from true
    class :math:`i` that were predicted as class :math:`j`.

**Interpretation:**
The plot makes it easy to identify a model's strengths and
weaknesses on a per-class basis.

* **Angle**: Each major angular sector represents a **True
  Class** (e.g., "True Class A").
* **Bars**: Within each sector, the different colored bars show
  how the samples from that true class were **predicted**. The
  legend indicates which color corresponds to which predicted
  class.
* **Radius**: The length of each bar represents the **proportion**
  (if normalized) or **count** of samples.
* **Ideal Performance**: A good model will have tall bars that
  match the sector's true class (e.g., the "Predicted Class A"
  bar is tallest in the "True Class A" sector) and very short
  bars for all other predicted classes.

**Use Cases:**

* To get a detailed, visual summary of a multiclass
  classifier's performance.
* To quickly identify which classes a model struggles with the most.
* To understand the specific patterns of confusion between
  classes (e.g., "Is Class A more often confused with B or C?").

Evaluating a binary classifier is one thing, but many real-world
problems require classifying items into multiple categories. This is
where a multiclass confusion matrix becomes essential. This plot is
specifically designed to help you untangle the complex patterns of
confusion between three or more classes.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Imagine you are building a model for an agricultural company to
   automatically classify images of crops into three categories: "Corn",
   "Wheat", and "Soybeans". After training your model, you need to
   diagnose its performance. Does it confuse one crop with another?

   This grouped polar bar chart will show us, for each true crop type,
   how the model distributed its predictions. (You can also use the
   convenient alias :func:`kdiagram.plot.evaluation.plot_polar_confusion_multiclass`
   for this function.)

   This plot provides a detailed map of the model's successes and
   failures. By examining the bars within each angular sector, we can
   pinpoint exactly where the model is getting confused.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    The plot reveals the model's per-class performance and specific
    confusion patterns with great clarity. The model demonstrates
    excellent performance for "Corn" and "Soybeans", as indicated by the
    dominant, correctly colored bar in each of their respective "True"
    sectors. The key issue, however, is revealed in the "True Wheat"
    sector. Here, the model is clearly confused, correctly identifying
    "Wheat" only about half the time, while misclassifying the other
    half of the samples as "Soybeans". This pinpoints a specific weakness
    that needs to be addressed.

This kind of granular, per-class analysis is vital for improving
multiclass models. To see the full code and learn more about this

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Classification Report**, a novel
visualization that displays the key performance metrics—Precision,
Recall, and F1-Score—for each class in a multiclass
classification problem. It provides a more detailed and
interpretable summary than a confusion matrix alone, making it
easy to diagnose a model's per-class performance at a glance.


**Mathematical Concept:**
This plot visualizes the three most common metrics for evaluating
a multiclass classifier on a per-class basis
:footcite:p:`Powers2011`.

1.  **Precision**: The ability of the classifier not to label as
    positive a sample that is negative. It answers: *"Of all the
    predictions for this class, how many were correct?"*

    .. math::
       :label: eq:precision

       \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}

2.  **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ability of the classifier to
    find all the positive samples. It answers: *"Of all the
    actual samples of this class, how many did the model find?"*

    .. math::
       :label: eq:recall

       \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}

3.  **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall,
    providing a single score that balances both metrics.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:f1_score

       \text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}

Each class is assigned an angular sector, and within that sector,
three bars are drawn, with their heights (radii) corresponding
to the scores for these metrics.

**Interpretation:**
The plot provides a granular, per-class breakdown of a
classifier's performance, making it easy to spot imbalances and
trade-offs.

* **Angle**: Each major angular sector represents a **True
  Class** (e.g., "Class Alpha").
* **Bars**: Within each sector, the three colored bars represent
  the key metrics: **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**.
* **Radius**: The length of each bar represents the score for
  that metric, from 0 at the center to 1 at the edge. A good
  model will have consistently tall bars across all metrics and
  classes.

**Use Cases:**

* To get a detailed, per-class summary of a multiclass
  classifier's performance beyond a single accuracy score.
* To diagnose the Precision vs. Recall trade-off for each class.
* To identify which specific classes a model is struggling to
  predict correctly, especially in imbalanced datasets.

A multiclass confusion matrix is great for seeing where a model gets
confused, but sometimes you need a more direct summary of its
performance on each class. The classification report, which visualizes
key metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, provides exactly
that, making it especially useful for diagnosing performance on
imbalanced datasets.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Let's continue with our agricultural company that needs to classify
   crop images. The dataset is imbalanced: there are many images of
   "Corn", but far fewer of "Wheat". A simple accuracy score could be
   misleading if the model performs poorly on the rare "Wheat" class.

   This polar report will give us a detailed, per-class breakdown of
   Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, so we can be confident in the
   model's performance on every single crop type.

      A polar bar chart showing the Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
      for each of the three crop classes, revealing performance
      imbalances.

   This plot gives us a granular summary of the model's strengths and
   weaknesses. By comparing the bar heights for each class, we can
   diagnose performance far more effectively than with a single
   accuracy score.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This report provides a granular breakdown of the model's performance
    beyond simple accuracy. The model performs exceptionally well on the
    "Corn" class, with all three metrics—Precision, Recall, and
    F1-Score—being very high. The most critical insight comes from the
    "Wheat" class, which represents the model's primary weakness. While
    its Precision is high (when it predicts Wheat, it's usually
    correct), its Recall is very low, meaning it fails to identify
    most of the true Wheat samples. This trade-off results in a mediocre
    F1-Score and suggests the model is too cautious when classifying this
    rare crop.

classifiers. To see the full implementation and learn more, please

Pinball Loss Plot (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.evaluation.plot_pinball_loss`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Pinball Loss Plot** to provide a
granular, per-quantile assessment of a probabilistic forecast's
accuracy :footcite:p:`Gneiting2007b`. While the CRPS gives a single 
score for the overall performance, this plot breaks that score down 
and shows the model's performance at *each individual quantile level*.

**Mathematical Concept**
The Pinball Loss, :math:`\mathcal{L}_{\tau}`, is a proper scoring
rule for evaluating a single quantile forecast :math:`q` at level
:math:`\tau` against an observation :math:`y`. It asymmetrically
penalizes errors, giving a weight of :math:`\tau` to
under-predictions and :math:`(1 - \tau)` to over-predictions.

.. math::
   :label: eq:pinball_loss_plot

   \mathcal{L}_{\tau}(q, y) =
   \begin{cases}
     (y - q) \tau & \text{if } y \ge q \\
     (q - y) (1 - \tau) & \text{if } y < q
   \end{cases}

This plot calculates the average Pinball Loss for each provided
quantile and visualizes these scores on a polar axis, where the
angle represents the quantile level and the radius represents the
loss.

**Interpretation:**
The plot provides a detailed breakdown of a probabilistic
forecast's performance across its entire distribution.

* **Angle**: Represents the **Quantile Level**, sweeping from 0
  to 1 around the circle.
* **Radius**: The radial distance from the center represents the
  **Average Pinball Loss** for that quantile. A **smaller radius
  is better**, indicating a more accurate forecast for that
  specific quantile.
* **Shape**: A good forecast will have a small and relatively
  symmetrical shape close to the center. An asymmetrical shape
  can reveal if the model is better at predicting the lower
  tail of the distribution than the upper tail, or vice-versa.


**Use Cases:**

* To get a granular, per-quantile view of a model's performance,
  which is more detailed than an overall score like the CRPS.
* To diagnose if a model is better at predicting the center of a
  distribution (e.g., the median, q=0.5) versus its tails
  (e.g., q=0.1 or q=0.9).
* To compare the per-quantile performance of multiple models by
  overlaying their plots.

So far, we have focused on evaluating single-point forecasts. However,
many modern applications require **probabilistic forecasts** that
predict an entire range of possible outcomes. The Pinball Loss plot is a
specialized tool designed to evaluate the accuracy of these quantile
forecasts at every level of the distribution.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Consider the volatile energy market, where a utility company must
   forecast next-day electricity prices to optimize its purchasing
   strategy. A single price prediction is insufficient; the company
   needs to understand the full range of potential price outcomes to
   manage risk. For example, accurately predicting the 95th percentile
   is vital for hedging against extreme price spikes, a common feature
   of these markets.

   The Pinball Loss plot is the perfect tool to diagnose such a
   probabilistic forecast. It visualizes the model's accuracy at each
   specific quantile, revealing whether it is equally skilled at
   predicting low, median, and critically high prices.

      :alt: A polar plot showing Pinball Loss per quantile for electricity prices.

      A polar plot where the angle represents the quantile level and
      the radius represents the average loss (lower is better).

   This plot provides a granular diagnostic of our probabilistic
   forecast. The goal is a shape that is small and close to the center,
   indicating low error across all quantile levels.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    As a lower radius is better, the plot reveals the model's
    performance across the full predictive distribution. The model is
    most accurate when predicting the **median** (0.50 quantile), as this
    point is closest to the center with the lowest loss. However, the
    plot reveals an important **asymmetry**: the loss is significantly
    higher for the upper quantiles (like 0.95) than for the lower
    ones. This indicates the model is much less accurate when
    predicting high-price spikes than it is at predicting more common,
    lower prices—a critical insight for risk management.

Evaluating the full predictive distribution is key to making robust,
data-driven decisions. To explore this advanced evaluation technique

.. _ug_plot_regression_performance:

Polar Performance Chart (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.evaluation.plot_regression_performance`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Performance Chart**, a grouped polar
bar chart designed to visually compare the performance of multiple
regression models across several evaluation metrics simultaneously.
It provides a holistic snapshot of model strengths and weaknesses,
making it easier to select the best model based on criteria beyond
a single score :footcite:p:`scikit-learn`.


**Mathematical Concept**
The plot visualizes a set of performance scores, which are
processed in three main steps:

1.  **Score Calculation**: For each model :math:`k` and each metric
    :math:`m`, a score :math:`S_{m,k}` is calculated. The function
    is designed to assume that a **higher score is always better**.
    To achieve this:
    
    - Standard scikit-learn error metrics are automatically
      negated (e.g., it uses ``neg_mean_absolute_error``).
    - The ``higher_is_better`` parameter allows the user to
      explicitly tell the function whether a lower value is better
      for any given metric (e.g., ``{'my_custom_error': False}``).
      The function will then negate the scores for that metric.

2.  **Normalization**: To make scores with different scales
    comparable, the scores for each metric are independently
    scaled to the range [0, 1] using Min-Max normalization. For a
    given metric :math:`m`, the normalized score for model :math:`k`
    is:

    .. math::
       :label: eq:perf_norm

       S'_{m,k} = \frac{S_{m,k} - \min(\mathbf{S}_m)}{\max(\mathbf{S}_m) - \min(\mathbf{S}_m)}

    where :math:`\mathbf{S}_m` is the vector of scores for all
    models on metric :math:`m`. A score of 1 represents the
    best-performing model for that metric, and a score of 0
    represents the worst.

3.  **Polar Mapping**:

    - Each metric is assigned its own angular sector, :math:`\theta_m`.
    - The normalized score, :math:`S'_{m,k}`, is mapped to the
      **radius** (height) of the bar for model :math:`k` within
      that sector.


**Interpretation:**
The plot provides a holistic, multi-metric view of model
performance, making it easy to identify trade-offs.

* **Angle**: Each angular sector represents a different
  **evaluation metric** (e.g., R², MAE, RMSE).
* **Bars**: Within each sector, the different colored bars represent
  the different models being compared.
* **Radius**: The length of each bar represents the model's
  **normalized score** for that metric. The green circle at the
  edge is the "Best Performance" line (a score of 1), and the
  red dashed circle is the "Worst Performance" line (a score of 0).
* **Shape**: The overall shape of a model's bars reveals its
  performance profile. A model with consistently long bars is a
  strong all-around performer.


**Use Cases:**

* To get a quick, visual summary of how multiple models perform
  across a range of different metrics.
* To identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model (e.g., "Is
  this model biased or just noisy?").
* For model selection when you need to balance trade-offs between
  different performance criteria.


While a simple radar chart is great for a quick comparison, sometimes
you need more control over the metrics, labels, and normalization when
evaluating regression models. This polar performance chart is a
highly customizable tool for creating a holistic,
multi-metric comparison.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   An analyst at a real estate investment firm has two regression
   models for predicting property values. "Model 1" is a standard,
   highly accurate model. "Model 2" is a newer, experimental model
   which is supposedly better at identifying highly profitable deals,
   but its overall accuracy is suspect.

   This plot allows them to visualize performance across standard
   metrics like R² and MAE in a single, normalized view, making it
   easy to quantify the trade-offs between the two approaches.

      A grouped polar bar chart comparing two regression models across
      multiple performance metrics, where the bar height represents
      the normalized score.

   This chart provides a clear, normalized comparison of model
   performance. The longest bar in each metric-sector indicates the
   winning model for that specific criterion.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This chart compares the two models on R² and Negative MAE, where a
    longer bar reaching towards the outer "Best Performance" circle is
    better. The visualization clearly shows that "Model 1 (Accurate)"
    is the superior performer on both standard metrics; its purple bars
    are significantly longer for both R² and Neg. MAE. While the bars
    for "Model 2 (Profitable)" are much shorter, they remain visible,
    allowing us to quantify its underperformance. This plot confirms
    that while Model 2 may be "profitable" by some other measure, it is
    demonstrably less accurate according to these core metrics.

This kind of multi-metric visualization is key to selecting a model
that aligns with your specific business goals, not just statistical
ideals. To see the full implementation, please visit the gallery.
