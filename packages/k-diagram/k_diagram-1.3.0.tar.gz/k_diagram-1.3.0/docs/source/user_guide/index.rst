Welcome to the `k-diagram` User Guide!

While the :doc:`../quickstart` provides a fast runnable example and the
:doc:`../gallery/index` showcases the various plots, this
guide aims to provide a deeper understanding of the concepts behind the
different visualizations and helper functions offered by `k-diagram`.

Here, you'll find explanations of:

* **What** each plot or utility does.
* **Why** specific polar representations or data structures are used.
* **How** to interpret the patterns and features within each diagram.
* **When** to use specific plots and utilities for effective model
  evaluation, uncertainty analysis, and data preparation.

Dive into the topics below to learn more about interpreting and applying
`k-diagram`'s specialized tools to gain richer insights from your
forecasting models and data.
