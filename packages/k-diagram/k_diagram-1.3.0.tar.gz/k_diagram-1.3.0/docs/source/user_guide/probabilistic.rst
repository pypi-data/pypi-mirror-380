Evaluating Probabilistic Forecasts
====================================

While prediction intervals provide a crucial view of uncertainty, a full
**probabilistic forecast** offers a more complete picture by assigning a
probability to all possible future outcomes. Evaluating these predictive
distributions requires moving beyond simple interval checks to assess two
fundamental and often competing qualities: **calibration** and **sharpness**
:footcite:p:`Gneiting2007b`.

* **Calibration** (or reliability) refers to the statistical consistency
  between the probabilistic forecasts and the observed outcomes. A
  well-calibrated forecast is "honest" about its own uncertainty.
* **Sharpness** refers to the concentration of the predictive distribution.
  A sharp forecast provides narrow, highly specific prediction intervals.

An ideal forecast is one that is both perfectly calibrated and maximally
sharp. The :mod:`kdiagram.plot.probabilistic` module provides a suite of
specialized polar plots to diagnose these two key properties.

PIT Histogram (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.probabilistic.plot_pit_histogram`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
Creates a **Polar Probability Integral Transform (PIT) histogram**, a
primary diagnostic for assessing the **calibration** (reliability) of a
probabilistic forecast. It answers: *Are the predicted probability
distributions statistically consistent with the observed outcomes?*

**Mathematical Concept**
The Probability Integral Transform (PIT) is foundational in forecast
verification :footcite:p:`Gneiting2007b`. For a continuous predictive
distribution with CDF :math:`F`, the PIT value for an observation
:math:`y` is :math:`F(y)`. If forecasts are perfectly calibrated, PIT
values across observations are i.i.d. uniform on :math:`[0,1]`.

When only a finite set of :math:`M` quantiles is available (common in ML
workflows), the PIT for observation :math:`y_i` can be approximated by
the fraction of forecast quantiles less than or equal to :math:`y_i`:

.. math::
   :label: eq:pit_quantile

   \mathrm{PIT}_i \;=\; \frac{1}{M} \sum_{j=1}^{M}
   \mathbf{1}\{\, q_{i,j} \le y_i \,\},

where :math:`q_{i,j}` is the :math:`j`-th quantile forecast for
observation :math:`i`, and :math:`\mathbf{1}` is the indicator function.
The histogram is then formed from the set of :math:`\mathrm{PIT}_i`
values.

**Interpretation:**

In the polar plot, PIT bins map to the **angle**; frequencies map to the
**radius**.

* **Perfect calibration:** A uniform PIT histogram. In polar form, bars
  lie on a **perfect circle**, matching the dashed “Uniform” reference.
* **Over-confidence (too narrow intervals):** **U-shaped** histogram:
  large counts near 0 and 1, few in the middle.
* **Under-confidence (too wide intervals):** **Hump-shaped** histogram:
  excess mass near the center.
* **Systemic bias:** Sloped or skewed histogram indicating forecasts are
  consistently too high or too low.

**Use Cases:**

* Visual assessment of probabilistic **calibration**.
* Diagnose **overconfidence**, **underconfidence**, or **bias**.
* Compare calibration across models before evaluating **sharpness**.

The first and most fundamental test of any probabilistic forecast is to
assess its **calibration**. A forecast is considered calibrated if its
predicted probability distributions are statistically consistent with the
observed outcomes. In essence, it's a test of the model's statistical
"honesty." The Probability Integral Transform (PIT) histogram is the
primary diagnostic tool for this task. Let's go for a practical example 
for a better understanding.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Let say a energy company relies on a model to produce probabilistic
   forecasts of the power output from a wind farm. Before using these
   forecasts for operational planning, they must verify that the model
   is well-calibrated. If the forecast intervals are consistently too
   narrow (over-confident) or too wide (under-confident), any
   decisions based on them could be costly.

   The polar PIT histogram will give us an immediate visual diagnosis of
   the forecast's calibration by comparing the distribution of PIT
   values to a perfect uniform circle.

      A polar PIT histogram used to diagnose the calibration of a
      probabilistic wind power forecast. Deviations from the dashed
      uniform circle indicate miscalibration.

   This plot provides an instant diagnosis of the forecast's
   statistical reliability. The shape of the histogram will tell us if
   the model is over-confident, under-confident, or biased.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    For a perfectly calibrated forecast, the blue histogram bars should
    form a complete circle matching the dashed red "Uniform" reference
    line. This plot, however, shows a distinct **U-shape**, with high
    frequencies concentrated at the extreme low and high ends of the PIT
    value range and a significant dip in the middle. This is the classic
    signature of an **over-confident** forecast, indicating that the
    model's prediction intervals are systematically too narrow and that
    the true outcomes fall outside of the predicted range more often
    than expected.

Diagnosing miscalibration is the essential first step in evaluating a
probabilistic model. To see the full implementation and explore other
common patterns, please visit the gallery.

.. _ug_plot_polar_sharpness:

Polar Sharpness Diagram (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.probabilistic.plot_polar_sharpness`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose**
This function creates a **Polar Sharpness Diagram** to visually
compare the **sharpness** (or precision) of one or more probabilistic
forecasts. While calibration assesses a forecast's reliability,
sharpness measures the concentration of its predictive distribution.
An ideal forecast is not only calibrated but also as sharp as
possible. This plot directly answers the question: *"Which model
provides the most precise (narrowest) forecast intervals?"*

**Mathematical Concept**
Sharpness is a property of the forecast alone and does not depend on
the observed outcomes :footcite:p:`Gneiting2007b`. It is typically
quantified by the average width of the prediction intervals.

1.  **Interval Width**: For each model and each observation :math:`i`,
    the width of the central prediction interval is calculated using
    the lowest (:math:`q_{min}`) and highest (:math:`q_{max}`)
    provided quantiles.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:interval_width

       w_i = y_{i, q_{max}} - y_{i, q_{min}}

2.  **Sharpness Score**: The sharpness score :math:`S` for each model
    is the average of these interval widths over all :math:`N`
    observations. This score is used as the **radial coordinate**
    in the polar plot. A **lower score is better**, indicating a
    sharper, more concentrated forecast.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:sharpness

       S = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i


**Interpretation**
The plot assigns each model its own angular sector for clear
separation, with the radial distance from the center representing
its sharpness.

* **Radius**: The distance from the center directly corresponds to
  the average prediction interval width. **Points closer to the
  center represent sharper, more desirable forecasts.**
* **Comparison**: The plot allows for an immediate visual comparison
  of the relative sharpness of different models.

**Use Cases:**

* To directly compare the precision (average interval width) of
  multiple forecasting models.
* To use in conjunction with a calibration plot (like the PIT
  Histogram) to understand the crucial **trade-off between a model's
  reliability and its sharpness**. A model might be very sharp but
  poorly calibrated, or vice-versa.
* To select a model that provides the best balance of sharpness and
  calibration for a specific application.

Once a forecast is deemed well-calibrated, the next crucial property
to evaluate is its **sharpness**. A calibrated forecast that is too
wide (e.g., "wind power will be between 0 and 100 MW") is reliable but
not very useful. Sharpness measures the concentration of the
predictive distribution, rewarding forecasts that are more precise.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Continuing with our wind power scenario, the energy company has two
   competing probabilistic models, "Model A" and "Model B". Initial
   checks have shown that both are reasonably well-calibrated. The company
   now needs to determine which model provides a more precise and
   therefore more economically valuable forecast.

   The polar sharpness diagram will provide a direct visual comparison
   of the models' average prediction interval widths. The model closer
   to the center of the plot is the sharper, more decisive one.

      :alt: A polar sharpness diagram comparing two models.

      A polar plot where the radial distance from the center
      represents the average prediction interval width for two
      competing models.

   This plot provides a clear and simple answer to the question of
   which model is more precise. The point closer to the center of the
   plot represents the sharper, and therefore more desirable, forecast.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    The plot provides a direct comparison of the models' precision,
    where points closer to the center represent sharper and more
    desirable forecasts. The visualization clearly shows that **"Model B"
    is demonstrably sharper than "Model A"**. This is confirmed by their
    respective average interval widths, with Model B's forecast being
    significantly more concentrated (a width of 32.69) compared to
    Model A's (49.06). Based solely on sharpness, Model B provides a
    more decisive and economically useful forecast.

An ideal forecast is both calibrated and sharp. To learn more about
this crucial trade-off and see the full code, explore the example in
our gallery.

.. _ug_plot_crps_comparison:

CRPS Comparison (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.probabilistic.plot_crps_comparison`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar CRPS Comparison Diagram** to provide a
high-level summary of a model's overall probabilistic skill. It uses
the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), a proper scoring rule
that assesses both **calibration** and **sharpness** simultaneously.
This plot answers the question: *"Which model performs best overall
when considering both reliability and precision?"*

**Mathematical Concept:**
The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) is a widely used
metric for evaluating probabilistic forecasts that generalizes the
Mean Absolute Error :footcite:p:`Gneiting2007b`. For a single
observation :math:`y` and a predictive CDF :math:`F`, it is defined as:

.. math::
   :label: eq:crps_integral

   \text{CRPS}(F, y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (F(x) -
   \mathbf{1}\{x \ge y\})^2 dx

where :math:`\mathbf{1}` is the Heaviside step function. A lower
CRPS value indicates a better forecast.

When the forecast is given as a set of :math:`M` quantiles
:math:`\{q_1, ..., q_M\}`, the CRPS can be approximated by
averaging the pinball loss :math:`\mathcal{L}_{\tau}` over the
quantile levels :math:`\tau \in \{ \tau_1, ..., \tau_M \}`. The
pinball loss for a single quantile forecast :math:`q` at level
:math:`\tau` is:

.. math::
   :label: eq:pinball_loss

   \mathcal{L}_{\tau}(q, y) =
   \begin{cases}
     (y - q) \tau & \text{if } y \ge q \\
     (q - y) (1 - \tau) & \text{if } y < q
   \end{cases}

This function calculates the average CRPS over all observations for
each model and plots this final score as the radial coordinate.


**Interpretation:**
The plot assigns each model its own angular sector, with the radial
distance from the center representing its overall performance.

* **Radius**: The distance from the center directly corresponds to
  the average CRPS. **Points closer to the center represent
  better-performing models.**
* **Comparison**: The plot provides an immediate visual summary of
  the relative performance of different models. It is a "bottom-line"
  metric but does not explain *why* one model is better (i.e.,
  whether due to superior calibration or superior sharpness).


**Use Cases**

* To get a quick, high-level summary of which model performs best
  overall when considering both calibration and sharpness.
* To use as a final comparison plot after using the PIT histogram
  and sharpness diagram to understand the components of the CRPS score.
* For model selection when a single, proper scoring rule is the
  primary decision criterion.

After assessing calibration and sharpness separately, it is often useful
to have a single, overall score that summarizes a probabilistic
forecast's quality. The Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) is
the industry standard for this, as it simultaneously rewards both
calibration and sharpness. A lower CRPS indicates a better overall
forecast.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   To conclude our wind power model evaluation, the energy company
   needs to make a final decision between "Model A" and "Model B".
   They have analyzed the models' calibration and sharpness, but now
   they need a definitive "bottom-line" metric to formally select the
   winner for deployment.

   The polar CRPS comparison plot provides this final verdict. It computes
   the average CRPS for each model and plots the scores, allowing for a
   quick, high-level summary of which model performs best overall.

   This plot provides the final verdict in our evaluation workflow.
   The model with the score closer to the center is the overall winner,
   achieving the best combined performance in both reliability and
   precision.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot gives a final verdict on overall performance, as the CRPS
    score rewards both calibration and sharpness, with lower scores
    being better. The chart clearly indicates that **"Model B" is the
    superior model overall**. Its position is substantially closer to
    the center, which is quantitatively supported by its much lower
    average CRPS of 1.223 compared to Model A's score of 1.834. This
    demonstrates that Model B achieves the best combined balance of
    reliability and precision.

Calibration-Sharpness Diagram (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.probabilistic.plot_calibration_sharpness`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Calibration-Sharpness Diagram**, a
powerful summary visualization that plots the fundamental trade-off
between a forecast's **calibration** (reliability) and its
**sharpness** (precision). Each model is represented by a single
point, allowing for an immediate and intuitive comparison of overall
probabilistic performance. The ideal forecast is located at the
center of the plot.

**Mathematical Concept:**
This plot synthesizes two key aspects of a probabilistic forecast
into a single point for each model. It is a novel visualization
developed as part of the analytics framework
:footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`.

1.  **Sharpness (Radius)**: The radial coordinate represents the
    forecast's sharpness, calculated as the average width of the
    prediction interval between the lowest and highest provided
    quantiles. A smaller radius is better (sharper).

    .. math::
       :label: eq:sharpness_score

       S = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_{i, q_{max}} - y_{i, q_{min}})

2.  **Calibration Error (Angle)**: The angular coordinate
    represents the forecast's calibration error. This is
    quantified by first calculating the Probability Integral
    Transform (PIT) values for each observation. The
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is then used to measure
    the maximum distance between the empirical CDF of these PIT
    values and the CDF of a perfect uniform distribution.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:calib_error

       E_{calib} = \sup_{x} | F_{PIT}(x) - U(x) |

    An error of 0 indicates perfect calibration. The angle is
    mapped such that :math:`\theta = E_{calib} \cdot \frac{\pi}{2}`,
    so 0° is perfect and 90° is the worst possible calibration.

**Interpretation:**
The plot provides a high-level summary of probabilistic forecast
quality, with the ideal model located at the center (origin).

* **Radius (Sharpness)**: The distance from the center. **Models
  closer to the center are sharper** (more precise).
* **Angle (Calibration Error)**: The angle from the 0° axis.
  **Models with a smaller angle are better calibrated**.
* **Overall Performance**: The best model is the one closest to the
  origin, as it represents the optimal balance of both low
  calibration error and high sharpness.


**Use Cases:**

* To quickly compare the overall quality of multiple probabilistic
  models in a single, decision-oriented view.
* To visualize the trade-off between a model's reliability and its
  precision. For example, one model might be very sharp but poorly
  calibrated, while another is well-calibrated but not very sharp.
* For model selection when a balanced performance between
  calibration and sharpness is the primary goal.

We have seen how to evaluate a forecast's calibration (reliability)
and its sharpness (precision) as separate concepts. This final
visualization brings them together. The calibration-sharpness diagram
distills the entire probabilistic performance of a model into a single
point, allowing for an immediate and decisive comparison of the crucial
trade-off between these two competing qualities.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Let's summarize our wind power forecasting evaluation. The energy
   company has three candidate models: **Model A (Under-Confident):** Known 
   to be well-calibrated but produces very wide, imprecise forecast intervals.
   **Model B (Over-Confident):** Produces very sharp, narrow intervals 
   but is poorly calibrated. **Model C (Balanced):** A newer model that 
   aims to provide a good compromise between reliability and precision.

   The calibration-sharpness diagram will plot each model as a single
   point. The goal is to find the model closest to the center of the
   plot, as this represents the optimal balance of perfect calibration
   (zero angle) and perfect sharpness (zero radius).

      :alt: A calibration-sharpness diagram comparing three models.

      A polar plot where each point represents a model. The angle
      shows calibration error, and the radius shows sharpness. The
      ideal model is at the center (0,0).

   This plot provides the ultimate summary for probabilistic model
   selection. A single glance reveals which model achieves the best
   compromise between being right and being useful.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot provides a powerful summary for model selection, where the
    ideal model is closest to the center (the origin). The plot
    visualizes a classic trade-off: **Model A** is well-calibrated (small
    angle) but not very sharp (large radius), a sign of under-confidence.
    In contrast, **Model B** is very sharp (small radius) but less
    well-calibrated (larger angle), which is characteristic of
    over-confidence. **Model C (Balanced)** emerges as the clear winner,
    as its position closest to the origin demonstrates that it achieves
    the best overall compromise between statistical reliability and
    predictive precision.

This decision-oriented plot is the ideal final step in a thorough
probabilistic forecast evaluation. To see the full implementation,

Polar Credibility Bands (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.probabilistic.plot_credibility_bands`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Credibility Bands** plot to
visualize the structure of a model's forecast distribution as a
function of another variable. It is a descriptive tool that answers
the question: *"How do my model's median prediction and its
uncertainty (interval width) change depending on a specific
feature?"*

**Mathematical Concept:**
This plot visualizes the conditional expectation of the forecast
quantiles. It is a novel visualization developed as part of the
analytics framework in :footcite:p:`kouadiob2025`.

1.  **Binning**: The data is first partitioned into :math:`K` bins,
    :math:`B_k`, based on the values in ``theta_col``.

2.  **Conditional Means**: For each bin :math:`B_k`, the mean
    of the lower quantile (:math:`\bar{q}_{low,k}`), median
    quantile (:math:`\bar{q}_{med,k}`), and upper quantile
    (:math:`\bar{q}_{up,k}`) are calculated.

    .. math::
       :label: eq:mean_quantiles

       \bar{q}_{j,k} = \frac{1}{|B_k|} \sum_{i \in B_k} q_{j,i}

    where :math:`j \in \{\text{low, med, up}\}`.

3.  **Visualization**: The plot displays:

    - A central line representing the mean median forecast
      (:math:`\bar{q}_{med,k}`).
    - A shaded band between the mean lower and upper bounds
      (:math:`\bar{q}_{low,k}` and :math:`\bar{q}_{up,k}`). The
      width of this band represents the average forecast
      sharpness for that bin.

**Interpretation:**
The plot reveals how the forecast distribution's center and spread
are related to the feature on the angular axis.

* **Central Line (Mean Median)**: The position of this line shows
  the average central tendency of the forecast for each bin.
  Trends in this line reveal if the model's predictions are
  correlated with the binned feature.
* **Shaded Band (Credibility Band)**: The width of this band
  visualizes the average forecast sharpness. If the band's width
  changes at different angles, it is a clear sign of
  **heteroscedasticity**—meaning the model's uncertainty is not
  constant but depends on the binned feature.

**Use Cases:**

* To diagnose if a model's uncertainty changes predictably with
  another feature (e.g., time, or the magnitude of the forecast
  itself).
* To visually inspect the conditional mean of a forecast.
* To communicate how the forecast distribution is expected to behave
  under different conditions.

Beyond checking for overall calibration, a deeper analysis involves
understanding if a model's uncertainty is itself predictable. Does the
forecast's precision change depending on other factors? This is the
question of **heteroscedasticity**, and the credibility bands plot is
designed to diagnose this exact behavior.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   Consider a retail business forecasting its daily sales. The sales
   patterns, and therefore the forecast uncertainty, are likely not
   the same every day. For instance, sales might be much more volatile
   and harder to predict on a busy Saturday than on a quiet Tuesday.

   This plot allows us to visualize how the model's median forecast
   and its uncertainty (the width of its credibility band) change for
   each day of the week, helping us to trust and understand the
   forecast's situational performance.

      :alt: A polar plot showing credibility bands by day of the week.

      A polar plot where each angular sector represents a day of the
      week, visualizing how the median forecast and its 80%
      credibility band change.

   This plot reveals how the center and spread of the forecast
   distribution relate to the day of the week. Let's examine the trends
   in the central line and the width of the shaded band.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
    This plot reveals how the forecast's central tendency and
    uncertainty change throughout the week. The "Mean Median Forecast"
    (black line) varies in radius, showing that the model correctly
    predicts higher sales on some days versus others. More importantly,
    the **width of the blue credibility band is not uniform**. It is
    noticeably wider for the days on the left and bottom of the plot,
    indicating that the model's forecast is much **less certain** and
    more volatile on these days (likely corresponding to weekends), a
    clear sign of heteroscedasticity.

Diagnosing this kind of conditional behavior is key to building more
sophisticated and trustworthy forecasting models. To explore this
example in more detail, please visit the gallery.
