Diagnosing Forecast Anomalies
========================================

A critical aspect of evaluating probabilistic forecasts is moving
beyond aggregate scores to understand the specific nature of a
model's failures. A forecast interval can fail in many ways: the
error might be small or large, random or systematic, biased
towards over- or under-prediction. Understanding these patterns
is essential for building trustworthy models, especially in high-
stakes applications where the cost of an error is significant
:footcite:p:`kouadioc2025`.

The :mod:`kdiagram.plot.anomaly` module provides a suite of
specialized visualizations designed to dissect these forecast
failures, which we term **anomalies**. These plots are built upon
the **Clustered Anomaly Severity (CAS)** score, a novel metric
that quantifies not just the magnitude of an error but also its
concentration. This allows for a deeper diagnosis of whether a
model's failures are random noise or indicative of a systematic,
clustered bias.

Polar Anomaly Severity Plot (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.anomaly.plot_anomaly_severity`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Anomaly Severity Plot**, a
primary diagnostic for analyzing forecast failures. It
identifies anomalies (where the true value falls outside the
predicted interval) and visualizes their **location**,
**magnitude**, **type**, and **clustering density** in a single,
compact polar view. It answers not just *if* a model fails,
but *how* and *where* it fails.

**Mathematical Concept**
This plot visualizes the key components of the Clustered
Anomaly Severity (CAS) score. For each anomaly, it maps four
distinct dimensions of information to visual properties.

1.  **Anomaly Magnitude** (:math:`m_i`): The severity of a
    failure, mapped to the **radius**.
2.  **Local Cluster Density** (:math:`d_i`): The concentration
    of failures, mapped to the **color**.
3.  **Anomaly Type**: Whether the failure was an over- or
    under-prediction, mapped to the **marker shape**.
4.  **Location**: The sample index, mapped to the **angle**.

For the full mathematical definitions of these components,
please see the documentation for the
:func:`~kdiagram.metrics.cluster_aware_severity_score`.

**Interpretation:**
The plot provides a rich, multi-dimensional view of a model's
failure modes.

* **Radius**: The distance from the center shows the **magnitude**
  of an anomaly. Points far from the center are severe failures.
* **Color**: The color of a point shows its **cluster density**.
  "Hotter" (brighter) colors indicate the anomaly is part of a
  dense cluster of other failures—a potential "hotspot".
* **Marker Shape**: The marker distinguishes the **type** of
  failure. By default, circles (`o`) are over-predictions
  (risk underestimated), while `X`'s are under-predictions.
* **Angle**: The angular position shows *where* in the dataset
  (sequentially) the failure occurred. Look for clusters of
  hot-colored, high-radius points at specific angles.

**Use Cases:**

* To get a detailed summary of forecast failures, moving beyond
  a simple coverage score.
* To diagnose if a model's failures are random noise or part of a
  systematic, clustered pattern.
* To identify "hotspots" of poor performance in a dataset.

While a simple coverage score tells you how often a model is
wrong, it doesn't tell you the story of *how* it's wrong. This
plot is designed to tell that story, revealing whether failures
are minor and scattered or severe and systematic—a critical
distinction for any high-stakes forecasting application.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   A logistics company uses a probabilistic model to forecast
   delivery times. An "anomaly" occurs when a package arrives
   outside its predicted window. It is critical to understand
   these failures: are they minor, random delays, or are there
   systematic issues causing large, clustered delays on
   specific routes or days?

   This plot will ignore all on-time deliveries and create a
   focused visualization of only the failures. The radius will
   show how severe each delay was, and the color will reveal if
   these delays are clustered together, pointing to a systemic
   problem that needs to be addressed.

      A polar scatter plot showing forecast failures, where radius is
      the severity, angle is the location, and color shows if the
      failures are clustered.

   This plot acts as a magnifying glass for your model's most
   significant errors. A sparse plot with cool-colored points near
   the center is ideal.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
   This plot instantly reveals a critical issue with the forecast
   model. There is a distinct **cluster of bright yellow points**
   in one angular region. These points are also located far from
   the center. This tells us two things simultaneously: (1) the
   failures in this region are **severe** (high magnitude), and
   (2) they are **systematically clustered** (high local density).
   This is a clear "hotspot" of poor performance that requires
   immediate investigation.

assessment and building robust models. To learn more about this
diagnostic, please explore the full example in the gallery.

.. _ug_plot_anomaly_profile:

Polar Anomaly Profile (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.anomaly.plot_anomaly_profile`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Anomaly Profile**, a stylized and
aesthetically focused visualization for forecast failures. It is
designed for high-impact figures in scientific papers, using the
metaphor of a "fiery ring" to represent hotspots of clustered
anomalies, with individual failures erupting from it as flares.

**Mathematical Concept**
This plot is a stylized representation of the key components of
the Clustered Anomaly Severity (CAS) score, transforming them
into a visual narrative.

1.  **Central Ring**: The angular dimension is divided into bins.
    Within each angular bin, the **average local anomaly density**
    is calculated. This average density determines the color of
    that segment of the ring, creating a smooth heatmap of
    failure concentration.
2.  **Flares**: Each individual anomaly is drawn as a line or
    "flare" that originates from the central ring.
    
    * The **length** of the flare is directly proportional to the
      **Anomaly Magnitude** of that specific failure.
    * The **direction** of the flare indicates the **Type** of
      anomaly: outward flares for over-predictions (risk
      underestimated) and inward flares for under-predictions.

**Interpretation:**
The plot provides an immediate, intuitive summary of a model's
failure characteristics.

* **The "Fiery Ring"**: The color of the central ring diagnoses
  **hotspots**. Bright, hot colors indicate angular regions where
  anomalies are highly clustered and systematic.
* **The "Flares"**: The flares diagnose **individual severity**
  and **bias**.
  
  * **Long flares** represent severe, high-magnitude failures that
    demand investigation.
  * A dominance of **outward flares** indicates a systematic bias
    towards underestimating risk (over-prediction).
  * A dominance of **inward flares** indicates a systematic bias
    towards overestimating risk (under-prediction).

**Use Cases:**

* To create a visually compelling summary of a model's failure
  profile for publications and presentations.
* To quickly identify not just where failures are clustered but
  also the severity of individual failures within those clusters.
* To communicate the nature of a model's bias (over- vs. under-
  prediction) in an intuitive way.

While a scatter plot shows the raw data, this profile plot tells
a story. It transforms a cloud of points into a clear picture of
risk hotspots and the severe events that erupt from them, making
it a powerful tool for communicating the nuances of forecast
reliability.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   An energy company needs to present the risk profile of their
   wind power forecast to stakeholders. A simple scatter plot of
   errors might look cluttered and difficult to interpret. They need
   a single, powerful image that summarizes where the model tends
   to fail and how severe those failures are.

   The Polar Anomaly Profile will provide this. The central ring
   will immediately show if failures are concentrated at certain
   times of day. The flares will vividly illustrate the magnitude
   of the largest forecast errors, providing a clear picture of
   the worst-case scenarios that the company needs to be prepared
   for.

      A stylized "fiery ring" plot where the ring's color shows
      anomaly hotspots and flares show the magnitude and type of
      individual failures.

   This plot provides a dramatic and intuitive visualization of the
   model's most significant errors, transforming raw data into an
   actionable diagnostic.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
   This plot clearly identifies two distinct hotspots of model
   failure. The central ring is brightly colored in two separate
   angular regions, indicating that the anomalies are not random but
   clustered. The flares reveal the nature of these failures: the
   hotspot on the right consists entirely of **outward red flares**,
   showing a systematic underestimation of risk. The hotspot on
   the left consists of **inward blue flares**, showing a systematic
   overestimation of risk. This powerful visualization instantly
   diagnoses two separate, systematic problems with the model.

This stylized plot is key to communicating complex failure modes
in an accessible way. To see the full implementation, please

.. _ug_plot_glyphs:

Polar Anomaly Glyph Plot (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.anomaly.plot_glyphs`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Polar Anomaly Glyph Plot**, an
informative diagnostic where each forecast failure (anomaly) is
represented by a custom symbol, or "glyph." The glyph's
properties—its location, shape, and color—encode multiple
characteristics of the anomaly simultaneously, offering a clear and
scientifically rigorous visualization suitable for in-depth analysis
and publication.

**Mathematical Concept**
This plot uses a glyph-based approach to encode multiple
dimensions of information for each forecast failure. The function
first calculates the detailed anomaly characteristics using the
:func:`~kdiagram.metrics.clustered_anomaly_severity` helper. It
then maps these characteristics to visual properties.

1.  **Angular Position (`θ`)**: The angle is determined by the
    `sort_by` parameter, which provides a meaningful order to the
    data points (e.g., by time or a spatial coordinate).
2.  **Radial Position (`r`)**: The radius is determined by the
    metric specified in the `radius` parameter (e.g.,
    'magnitude', 'severity'). This value is normalized to [0, 1]
    for consistent visual scaling.
3.  **Glyph Color**: The color is determined by the metric
    specified in the `color_by` parameter (e.g.,
    'local_density').
4.  **Glyph Shape**: The shape of the marker distinguishes the
    **Type** of anomaly.

**Interpretation:**
Each glyph on the plot is a rich, multi-dimensional data point.

* **Angle**: Shows *where* in the sorted sequence the anomaly
  occurred.
* **Radius**: Shows the **normalized** value of the chosen
  radial metric. A larger radius means a higher value. For
  `radius='magnitude'`, it shows the relative severity.
* **Color**: Reveals the value of the `color_by` metric.
  By default, "hotter" colors indicate the anomaly is part of a
  dense cluster, a "hotspot" of failures.
* **Shape**: Provides an intuitive visual metaphor for the
  anomaly type:
    
  * `▲` (up-triangle): **Over-prediction**, where the true
    value was higher than the upper bound (risk underestimated).
  * `▼` (down-triangle): **Under-prediction**, where the true
    value was lower than the lower bound (risk overestimated).

**Use Cases:**

* For a comprehensive, multi-faceted diagnosis of forecast
  failures in a single plot.
* To create publication-quality figures that are both
  aesthetically pleasing and information-dense.
* To explore complex relationships between the magnitude,
  clustering, and type of anomalies.

A standard scatter plot can become cluttered. By using glyphs,
this plot packs more information into each point, allowing for a
deeper and more intuitive understanding of exactly how and where a
model is failing.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   A climate scientist is analyzing a model that predicts daily
   sea surface temperatures. They need to understand not just the
   size of the prediction errors, but also whether these errors
   are clustered during specific times of the year (e.g., during
   summer heatwaves) and whether the model tends to under- or
   over-predict extreme events.

   The Polar Anomaly Glyph Plot is the perfect tool for this. By
   setting `sort_by='time'`, the angle will represent the day of
   the year. The radius (`magnitude`) will show how large the
   errors are, and the color (`local_density`) will reveal if these
   errors are clustered. The glyph shape will instantly show if
   the model failed by predicting temperatures that were too high
   or too low.

      A polar glyph plot where each triangle represents a forecast
      failure. Its position, shape, and color reveal the failure's
      location, type, magnitude, and clustering.

   This plot reveals the specific character of the model's failures
   at a glance, turning a complex dataset into an actionable diagnostic.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
   This glyph plot immediately reveals a systematic, seasonal
   failure in the forecast model. There is a distinct **cluster of
   bright yellow, outward-pointing triangles (`▲`)** in the angular
   region corresponding to the summer months. This tells us several
   things: (1) The failures are **clustered** (bright color), not
   random. (2) They are all **over-predictions**, meaning the model
   systematically underestimated the summer temperatures. (3) The
   **large radius** of these glyphs shows that the magnitudes of
   these failures were significant.

This level of detail is crucial for diagnosing and improving
sophisticated forecasting models. To see the full implementation,

.. _ug_plot_cas_profile:

Cartesian Anomaly Profile (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.anomaly.plot_cas_profile`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Cartesian Anomaly Profile**, a non-polar
diagnostic plot of forecast failures. It is highly effective for
sequential data, such as time series, where the x-axis can
represent time or sample index. The plot visualizes an
anomaly's location, magnitude, type, and clustering density.

**Mathematical Concept:**
This plot uses a standard Cartesian coordinate system to visualize
the key components of the Clustered Anomaly Severity (CAS) score.
It is the direct, non-polar counterpart to the polar glyph plot,
maintaining the same core principles for encoding information
:footcite:t:`kouadioc2025`.

1.  **X-axis**: Represents the sample index, showing *when* or
    *where* in the sequence a failure occurred.
2.  **Y-axis**: Represents the **Anomaly Magnitude** (:math:`m_i`),
    showing the severity of each failure.
3.  **Color**: Represents the **Local Cluster Density**
    (:math:`d_i`), with hotter colors indicating "hotspots" of
    concentrated failures.
4.  **Marker Shape**: Represents the **Type** of anomaly (over- vs.
    under-prediction).

**Interpretation:**
The plot provides a clear, sequential view of a model's failure
modes.

* **X-axis**: Shows the location of failures. Look for failures
  concentrated in specific ranges (e.g., at the beginning or
  end of a time series).
* **Y-axis**: The height of each point shows its **magnitude**.
  Taller points are more severe failures.
* **Color**: The color of each point reveals if it is part of a
  **cluster**. A group of bright yellow points indicates a
  "hotspot" of systematic failure.
* **Marker Shape**: The shape distinguishes the failure **type**.
  Upward triangles (`▲`) are over-predictions (risk
  underestimated), while downward triangles (`▼`) are under-
  predictions.

**Use Cases:**

* To diagnose forecast failures in a familiar, non-polar format.
* To clearly visualize trends or regime changes in model
  performance over time.
* To identify if failure hotspots are persistent or transient in
  sequential data.

While polar plots excel at showing cyclical patterns, a
Cartesian plot is often superior for analyzing linear or
sequential data. This plot provides a powerful and intuitive way
to see not just *if* your model is failing, but exactly *when*
and *how*.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   An economist is using a model to forecast monthly inflation. They
   need to diagnose if the model's prediction interval failures are
   random, or if they are clustered during specific economic
   conditions (e.g., at the start of a recession).

   The Cartesian Anomaly Profile is the ideal tool. The x-axis
   will represent the month, and the plot will show the magnitude
   and type of any forecast failures over time. A cluster of
   brightly colored, high-magnitude triangles at the end of the
   time series would be a clear signal that the model is failing
   to adapt to a new economic regime.

      :alt: A Cartesian anomaly profile plot.

      A Cartesian plot showing forecast failures over time, where
      the y-axis is the failure magnitude, and the color reveals
      failure hotspots.

   This plot provides a clear, sequential story of model
   performance, making it easy to spot trends in forecast
   failures.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
   This profile plot clearly reveals a change in the model's
   performance over time. For the first ~300 samples, there are no
   anomalies. However, a distinct **cluster of bright yellow,
   high-magnitude, upward-pointing triangles (`▲`)** appears
   towards the end of the series. This provides a critical
   insight: the model was reliable initially, but it has recently

Layered Anomaly Profile (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.anomaly.plot_cas_layers`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function creates a **Layered Anomaly Profile**, a
comprehensive, non-polar diagnostic that visualizes a forecast,
its failures, and its severity scores in a set of stacked,
linked panels. It is especially powerful for analyzing
sequential data, such as time series, providing a clear, layered
story of model performance.

**Mathematical Concept**
This plot decomposes the components of the Clustered Anomaly
Severity (CAS) score and visualizes them in relation to the
original forecast. The visualization is constructed in two linked
panels, an approach common in advanced data visualization to show
both raw data and derived metrics simultaneously.

1.  **Top Panel**: This panel shows the primary forecast context.
    It plots the true values, :math:`y_i`, against the prediction
    interval, :math:`[\hat{y}_{i,q_{lower}}, \hat{y}_{i,q_{upper}}]`.
    Anomalies are overlaid as glyphs, where the color is mapped to
    the **severity score**, :math:`s_i = m_i \cdot d_i`.
2.  **Bottom Panel**: This panel provides a detailed breakdown of
    the severity. It displays the per-sample **severity score**
    :math:`s_i` as vertical bars. Optionally, it can overlay a
    line representing the **local anomaly density** :math:`d_i`,
    making it easy to see how the "hotspots" contribute to the
    final severity score.

**Interpretation:**

The linked panels provide a rich, multi-layered view for
diagnosing model performance.

* **Top Panel (Forecast Context)**:

  * The shaded area shows the model's **prediction interval**.
  * The dark line shows the **true values**.
  * `▲` and `▼` markers appear wherever the true value escapes
    the interval. Their color indicates the **severity** of the
    failure—brighter, hotter colors are more severe.

* **Bottom Panel (Severity Breakdown)**:

  * The height of the **vertical bars** shows the **severity
    score** for each point. Tall, hot-colored bars pinpoint the
    most critical failures.
  * The solid black line (`show_density=True`) traces the **local
    anomaly density**. Peaks in this line correspond to the
    "hotspots" of clustered failures.

**Use Cases:**

* For a complete, all-in-one diagnosis of a forecast and its
  failures.
* To clearly link anomaly severity back to the original forecast
  context (e.g., "Do severe failures only happen when the true
  value is high?").
* To create detailed, publication-quality figures that present a
  full story of model performance.

This plot is arguably the most comprehensive diagnostic in the
module, moving beyond a simple plot of failures to show the full
context of the forecast, the anomalies, and the underlying components
of their severity score in a single, coherent visualization.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   A financial analyst needs to present a complete picture of a stock
   price forecasting model to their risk management team. They need
   to show not just the forecast itself, but also clearly identify
   any prediction interval failures and explain why some failures are
   considered more severe than others.

   The Layered Anomaly Profile is the perfect tool. The top panel
   will show the familiar time series of the true price against the
   model's prediction band, with severe failures clearly marked.
   The bottom panel will provide the "reasoning," showing the
   severity score for each day and highlighting the hotspots where
   the model's performance was most unreliable.

      :alt: A layered Cartesian plot of anomalies and severity.

      A two-panel plot. The top shows a time series forecast with
      anomalies marked. The bottom shows the severity of those
      anomalies.

   This plot provides a full narrative of model performance, from the
   high-level forecast to the granular details of each failure.

   **Quick Interpretation:**
   This layered plot provides a complete story. The **top panel**
   shows that the model's prediction interval (shaded area)
   successfully tracks the true value (black line) for most of the
   period. However, a significant failure occurs around sample 200,
   where a cluster of bright red and yellow upward-pointing
   triangles (`▲`) appear. The **bottom panel** explains why these
   failures are critical: the vertical bars show extremely high
   **severity scores** in this region, and the black line confirms
   that this is a **hotspot** of high anomaly density.

This comprehensive diagnostic is essential for moving from simply
identifying errors to truly understanding them. To see the full
