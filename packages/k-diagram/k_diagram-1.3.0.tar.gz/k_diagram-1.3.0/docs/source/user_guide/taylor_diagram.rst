Taylor Diagrams
=================

Evaluating the performance of forecast or simulation models often
requires considering multiple aspects simultaneously. How well does the
model capture the overall variability (standard deviation) of the observed
phenomenon? How well does the pattern of the model's output correlate
with the observed pattern? A Taylor Diagram, developed by Karl E. Taylor
:footcite:p:`Taylor2001`, provides an elegant solution by graphically 
summarizing these key statistics in a single, concise plot.

Taylor diagrams are widely used, particularly in climate science and
meteorology, but are applicable to any field where model outputs need
rigorous comparison against a reference dataset (observations). They
allow for the simultaneous assessment of correlation, standard
deviation, and (implicitly) the centered root-mean-square difference
(RMSD) between different models and the reference.

``k-diagram`` provides flexible functions to generate these informative
diagrams.

Interpreting Taylor Diagrams
-------------------------------

Regardless of the specific function used, interpreting a Taylor Diagram
involves looking at the position of points (representing models or
predictions) relative to the reference point and the axes:

* **Reference Point/Arc:** Typically marked on the horizontal axis (at
  angle 0) or as an arc. Its radial distance from the origin represents
  the standard deviation of the reference (observed) data (:math:`\sigma_r`).
* **Radial Axis (Distance from Origin):** Represents the standard
  deviation of the prediction (:math:`\sigma_p`). Models with standard
  deviations similar to the reference will lie near the reference arc.
* **Angular Axis (Angle from Horizontal/Reference):** Represents the
  correlation coefficient (:math:`\rho`) between the prediction and the
  reference, usually via the relation :math:`\theta = \arccos(\rho)`.
  Points closer to the horizontal axis (smaller angle) have higher
  correlations.
* **Distance to Reference Point:** The *straight-line distance* between a
  model point and the reference point is proportional to the centered
  Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) between the prediction and the
  reference.
* **Overall Skill:** Generally, models plotted closer to the reference
  point are considered more skillful, indicating a better balance of
  correlation and amplitude of variations (standard deviation).

Detailed Explanations
------------------------

Let's explore the specific functions.

.. _ug_taylor_diagram:

Flexible Taylor Diagram (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.taylor_diagram.taylor_diagram`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function provides a highly flexible way to generate Taylor Diagrams.
It uniquely accepts either **pre-computed statistics** (standard
deviations and correlation coefficients) or the **raw data arrays**
(predictions and reference) from which it calculates these statistics
internally. It also offers several strategies for adding an optional
**background color mesh** to highlight specific regions of the diagram.

**Mathematical Concept:**
The plot is based on the geometric relationship between the standard
deviations of the reference (:math:`\sigma_r`) and prediction
(:math:`\sigma_p`), their correlation coefficient (:math:`\rho`), and the
centered Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD):

.. math::

   RMSD^2 = \sigma_p^2 + \sigma_r^2 - 2\sigma_p \sigma_r \rho

On the diagram:

* Radius (distance from origin) = :math:`\sigma_p`
* Angle (from reference axis) = :math:`\theta = \arccos(\rho)`
* Distance from Reference Point = RMSD

**Interpretation:**

* Evaluate model points based on their proximity to the reference point
  (lower RMSD is better), their angular position (lower angle means
  higher correlation), and their radial position relative to the
  reference arc/point (matching standard deviation is often desired).
* If `cmap` is used, the background shading provides additional context
  based on the `radial_strategy`:
    
  * `'rwf'`: Emphasizes points with high correlation *and* standard
    deviation close to the reference.
  * `'convergence'` / `'norm_r'`: Simple radial gradients.
  * `'center_focus'`: Highlights a central region.
  * `'performance'`: Highlights the area around the best-performing
    point based on correlation and std. dev. matching the reference.

**Use Cases:**

* Comparing multiple model results when only summary statistics
  (std. dev., correlation) are available.
* Generating standard Taylor diagrams from raw model output and
  observation arrays.
* Creating visually enhanced diagrams with background shading to guide
  interpretation towards specific performance criteria.
* Customizing the appearance of the reference marker and plot labels.

**Advantages:**

* High flexibility in accepting either pre-computed statistics or raw
  data arrays.
* Offers multiple strategies for informative background shading to
  enhance interpretation.
* Provides options for customizing reference display and label sizes.


.. _ug_plot_taylor_diagram_in:

Taylor Diagram with Background Shading (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.taylor_diagram.plot_taylor_diagram_in`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function specializes in creating Taylor Diagrams with a prominent
**background color mesh** that visually encodes the correlation domain or
other performance metrics. It requires raw prediction and reference arrays
as input and offers specific strategies for generating the background.

**Mathematical Concept:**
Same fundamental relationship as `taylor_diagram`: maps standard
deviation (:math:`\sigma_p`) to radius and correlation (:math:`\rho`) to
angle (:math:`\theta = \arccos(\rho)`). The key feature is the generation
of the background color field `CC` based on `radial_strategy`:

* `'convergence'`: :math:`CC = \cos(\theta)` (directly maps correlation).
* `'norm_r'`: :math:`CC = r / \max(r)` (maps normalized radius).
* `'performance'`: :math:`CC = \exp(-(\sigma_p - \sigma_{best})^2 / \epsilon_\sigma) \cdot \exp(-(\theta - \theta_{best})^2 / \epsilon_\theta)`
  (Gaussian-like function centered on the best model point).

**Interpretation:**

* Interpret model points relative to the reference point/arc as described
  in the general interpretation guide.
* The **background color** provides context:

  * With `'convergence'`, colors directly map to correlation values
    (e.g., warmer colors for higher correlation).
  * With `'norm_r'`, colors show relative standard deviation.
  * With `'performance'`, the brightest color highlights the region
    closest to the best-performing input model.
* The `zero_location` and `direction` parameters change the orientation
  of the plot, affecting where correlation=1 appears and whether angles
  increase clockwise or counter-clockwise.

**Use Cases:**

* Creating visually rich Taylor diagrams where the background emphasizes
  correlation levels or proximity to the best model.
* Comparing models when a strong visual cue for correlation or relative
  performance across the diagram space is desired.
* Generating diagrams with specific orientations (e.g., correlation=1 at
  the top North position).

**Advantages:**

* Provides built-in, visually informative background shading options
  focused on correlation or performance.
* Offers fine control over plot orientation (`zero_location`, `direction`).


.. _ug_plot_taylor_diagram:

Basic Taylor Diagram (:func:`~kdiagram.plot.taylor_diagram.plot_taylor_diagram`)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Purpose:**
This function appears to offer a potentially simpler interface for
generating a standard Taylor Diagram, requiring raw prediction and
reference arrays as input. It compares models based on standard
deviation (radius) and correlation (angle).

**Mathematical Concept:**
Utilizes the same core principles as the other Taylor diagram functions,
mapping standard deviation (:math:`\sigma_p`) to the radial coordinate
and correlation (:math:`\rho`) to the angular coordinate
(:math:`\theta = \arccos(\rho)`).

**Interpretation:**

* Interpret points based on their standard deviation (radius),
  correlation (angle), and distance to the reference point (RMSD) as
  outlined in the general interpretation guide above.
* Customization options like `zero_location`, `direction`, and
  `angle_to_corr` allow tailoring the plot's appearance and labeling.

**Use Cases:**

* Generating standard Taylor diagrams for model evaluation when background
  shading is not required.
* Comparing multiple predictions against a common reference based on
  correlation and standard deviation.

**Advantages:**

* May offer a more streamlined interface if fewer customization options
  are needed compared to `taylor_diagram` or `plot_taylor_diagram_in`.

A Practical Case Study: Evaluating Climate Models
---------------------------------------------------

The Taylor Diagram is an indispensable tool in fields like climate
science for evaluating the performance of complex simulations. Let's
walk through a realistic case study to see how each of the ``k-diagram``
Taylor Diagram functions can be used in a complete analysis workflow.

.. admonition:: Practical Example
   :class: pratical-example

   A climate research institute has developed three different Global
   Climate Models (GCMs) to simulate historical monthly surface
   temperatures. They need to compare how well each model's output
   corresponds to a reference dataset of actual observations. The goal
   is to find the model that best captures both the pattern
   (correlation) and the magnitude of climate variability (standard
   deviation).

**Step 1: The Standard Comparison with ``plot_taylor_diagram``**

The first step is always a clean, standard comparison. The
researchers want to see the performance of their three models—"A
(High-Var)", "B (Low-Corr)", and "C (Balanced)"—on a single,
uncluttered plot. The ``plot_taylor_diagram`` function is perfect
for this initial assessment.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> import kdiagram as kd
  >>>
  >>> # --- 1. Simulate historical observations and model outputs ---
  >>> np.random.seed(0)
  >>> reference = np.random.normal(15, 2.5, 360) # Observed temperatures
  >>>
  >>> # Model A: Good correlation, but too much variability
  >>> y_pred_A = reference + np.random.normal(0, 1.5, 360)
  >>> # Model B: Lower variability, but lower correlation
  >>> y_pred_B = reference * 0.7 + np.random.normal(0, 1.2, 360)
  >>> # Model C: A well-balanced model
  >>> y_pred_C = reference * 0.95 + np.random.normal(0, 0.8, 360)
  >>>
  >>> # --- 2. Generate the standard Taylor Diagram ---
  >>> ax1 = kd.plot_taylor_diagram(
  ...     y_pred_A, y_pred_B, y_pred_C,
  ...     reference=reference,
  ...     names=['A (High-Var)', 'B (Low-Corr)', 'C (Balanced)'],
  ...     title='Step 1: Standard Climate Model Comparison'
  ... )

  :align: center
  :width: 80%
  :alt: A standard Taylor Diagram comparing three climate models.

  A standard Taylor Diagram showing the performance of three climate
  models relative to the reference observations.

This initial plot gives us our first look at the models' performance.
Let's analyze the position of each point relative to the "Reference"
marker.

.. topic:: Quick Interpretation

   This initial comparison shows that "Model C (Balanced)" is the best
   performer among the three. Its point (gray) is located closest to the
   red "Reference" point, indicating it has the lowest overall error.
   The plot reveals the specific trade-offs: "Model A" achieves a high
   correlation but overestimates the climate's variability (its standard
   deviation is too high), while "Model B" both underestimates the
   variability and has a lower correlation. Model C strikes the best
   balance of both high correlation and realistic variability.

**Step 2: Adding Context with ``plot_taylor_diagram_in``**

Next, the researchers want to add more visual context to their
analysis. They decide to create a version of the diagram where the
background is colored based on the correlation value, providing an
intuitive heatmap of performance. The ``plot_taylor_diagram_in``
function, with its built-in background shading, is ideal for this.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> # --- Use the same data as Step 1 ---
  >>>
  >>> # --- Generate the Taylor Diagram with background shading ---
  >>> ax2 = kd.plot_taylor_diagram_in(
  ...     y_pred_A, y_pred_B, y_pred_C,
  ...     reference=reference,
  ...     names=['A (High-Var)', 'B (Low-Corr)', 'C (Balanced)'],
  ...     radial_strategy='convergence', # Color by correlation
  ...     cmap='plasma',
  ...     title='Step 2: Comparison with Correlation Shading'
  ... )

.. figure:: ../images/userguide_plot_taylor_diagram_in.png
  :align: center
  :width: 80%
  :alt: A Taylor Diagram with background shading for correlation.

  A Taylor Diagram where the background color directly visualizes
  the correlation, with warmer colors indicating higher correlation.

The background color now provides an immediate visual guide to the
high-performance regions of the plot, making the interpretation
even more intuitive.

.. topic:: Quick Interpretation

   This diagram enhances the standard plot by adding a background color
   gradient, where warmer, brighter colors (yellow) indicate higher
   correlation. The shading provides immediate visual context for the
   models' performance. It instantly highlights that "Model A" and
   "Model C" fall within the high-performance yellow and orange regions,
   visually confirming their strong correlation with the reference data.
   In contrast, "Model B" is situated in a cooler, less vibrant area,
   emphasizing its lower correlation score relative to the others.
 

**Step 3: Incorporating External Data with ``taylor_diagram``**

Finally, a collaborating institution sends in summary statistics
for a fourth, computationally expensive model, "D (External)". The
researchers do not have the raw prediction data, only the
pre-computed standard deviation and correlation coefficient.

The highly flexible ``taylor_diagram`` function is the only one that
can handle this situation, as it accepts pre-computed statistics
directly. They can use it to add Model D to their original comparison.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> # --- 1. Use pre-computed stats for the first three models ---
  >>> stddevs = [np.std(y_pred_A), np.std(y_pred_B), np.std(y_pred_C)]
  >>> corrs = [
  ...     np.corrcoef(reference, y_pred_A)[0, 1],
  ...     np.corrcoef(reference, y_pred_B)[0, 1],
  ...     np.corrcoef(reference, y_pred_C)[0, 1]
  ... ]
  >>> names = ['A (High-Var)', 'B (Low-Corr)', 'C (Balanced)']
  >>>
  >>> # --- 2. Add the stats for the new external model ---
  >>> stddevs.append(2.6) # Pre-computed std. dev. for Model D
  >>> corrs.append(0.98)  # Pre-computed correlation for Model D
  >>> names.append('D (External)')
  >>>
  >>> # --- 3. Generate the plot from statistics ---
  >>> ax3 = kd.taylor_diagram(
  ...     stddev=stddevs,
  ...     corrcoef=corrs,
  ...     names=names,
  ...     reference=reference, # Still need reference for its std. dev.
  ...     title='Step 3: Adding a Model from External Statistics'
  ... )

.. figure:: ../images/userguide_taylor_diagram_flexible.png
  :align: center
  :width: 80%
  :alt: A Taylor Diagram plotted from pre-computed statistics.

  A Taylor Diagram generated from a mix of calculated and
  pre-computed statistics, demonstrating the function's
  flexibility.

This final diagram allows for a complete comparison across all four
models, even when the raw data for one is unavailable.

.. topic:: Quick Interpretation

   This plot demonstrates the function's flexibility by incorporating
   "Model D" using only its pre-computed statistics. The primary finding
   is that all four models significantly overestimate the observed
   climate variability, as their points are located at a much larger
   radius than the "Reference" star. However, among them, "Model D
   (External)" and "Model C" are the top performers due to their very
   high correlation scores (angles close to zero). Model D is arguably
   the best of the group, as its near-perfect correlation makes it the
   closest to the reference point in terms of overall error (RMSD).

Diagram functions in ``k-diagram`` can be used together to conduct a
thorough and flexible model evaluation. To explore these examples in
