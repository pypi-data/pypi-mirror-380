Taylor Diagrams
====================

This gallery page focuses on Taylor Diagrams, which provide a concise
visual summary of model performance. They compare key statistics like
correlation, standard deviation, and Centered Root Mean Square Difference
(CRMSD) between one or more models (or predictions) and a reference
(observed) dataset.

A Taylor Diagram :footcite:p:`Taylor2001` conveys three key
statistics on a 2D plot, allowing for a dense, quantitative
comparison of model performance against a reference dataset (often
called "observations"). This geometric relationship is not just an 
analogy; it is a direct consequence of the mathematical definitions of
the statistics involved. The Law of Cosines provides the geometric framework to
visualize a fundamental statistical identity.

**Deriving the Relationship**

Let's start with the definition of the CRMSD. It is calculated on data 
where the means have been subtracted (denoted by primes: :math:`m'` and :math:`r'`).

1.  The squared CRMSD is the mean of the squared differences:

    .. math::

       CRMSD^2 = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N} (m'_k - r'_k)^2

2.  Expanding the squared term :math:`(a-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab` gives:

    .. math::

       CRMSD^2 = \frac{1}{N}\sum(m'_k)^2 + \frac{1}{N}\sum(r'_k)^2 - \frac{2}{N}\sum m'_k r'_k

3.  We can recognize each term in this expansion:

    * :math:`\frac{1}{N}\sum(m'_k)^2` is the variance of the model (:math:`\sigma_{model}^2`).
    * :math:`\frac{1}{N}\sum(r'_k)^2` is the variance of the reference (:math:`\sigma_{ref}^2`).
    * :math:`\frac{1}{N}\sum m'_k r'_k` is the covariance between the model and reference.

4.  Substituting these back, we get:

    .. math::

       CRMSD^2 = \sigma_{model}^2 + \sigma_{ref}^2 - 2 \cdot \text{cov}(m, r)

5.  Finally, we use the definition of the correlation coefficient,
    :math:`R = \frac{\text{cov}(m, r)}{\sigma_{model} \sigma_{ref}}`.
    Rearranging this gives :math:`\text{cov}(m, r) = R \cdot \sigma_{model} \sigma_{ref}`.
    Substituting this into our equation yields the final relationship:

    .. math::
       :label: eq:taylor_cossine

       CRMSD^2 = \sigma_{model}^2 + \sigma_{ref}^2 - 2 \sigma_{model} \sigma_{ref} R

**The Connection to the Law of Cosines**

Now, compare this final equation to the Law of Cosines for a triangle
with sides *a*, *b*, *c*, and an angle :math:`\gamma` between sides
*a* and *b*:

.. math::

   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos(\gamma)

The two equations have the exact same form. By mapping the statistical
terms to the geometric terms, we get:

* Side *a* :math:`\rightarrow` :math:`\sigma_{ref}` (Standard deviation of reference)
* Side *b* :math:`\rightarrow` :math:`\sigma_{model}` (Standard deviation of model)
* Side *c* :math:`\rightarrow` **CRMSD**
* :math:`\cos(\gamma)` :math:`\rightarrow` **R** (Correlation Coefficient)

**From Mathematics to Visualization**

This remarkable equivalence is the conceptual foundation of the Taylor
Diagram. It allows us to take an abstract statistical relationship and
plot it in a simple, intuitive geometric space.

In the diagram, the standard deviations of the reference and the model
are plotted as two sides of a triangle originating from the origin. The
angle between them is set as :math:`\theta = \arccos(R)`. Because of
the Law of Cosines, the length of the third side of the triangleâ€”the
line connecting the model point to the reference pointâ€”is guaranteed to
be equal to the CRMSD.

This transforms a complex, multi-metric evaluation into a simple visual
task: finding the point on the diagram that is closest to the reference.
See the full details in the user guide section: :ref:`userguide_taylor_diagram`.
Now, let's break down the components of this  diagram and its variants.

.. admonition:: Plot Anatomy
   :class: anatomy

   * **Reference Point:** A single point, typically plotted on the
     horizontal axis, that represents the "perfect" model. Its radial
     distance is the standard deviation of the reference data, and its
     correlation is, by definition, 1.0.
   * **Azimuthal Angle (Î¸):** The angle from the horizontal axis
     represents the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** (*R*). A smaller
     angle indicates a higher correlation between the model and the
     reference. The axis is typically scaled with :math:`\arccos(R)`.
   * **Radial Distance (r):** The distance from the origin (the point
     (0,0)) represents the **Standard Deviation** (:math:`\sigma`) of the
     model's predictions. The plot often includes one or more circular
     arcs to show isocontours of standard deviation.
   * **Distance from Reference:** The distance between any model's point
     and the reference point represents the **Centered Root Mean Square
     Difference (CRMSD)**. This is a measure of the overall model
     skill; the closer a model's point is to the reference point, the
     better its performance.
   * **Model Points:** Each colored marker on the plot corresponds to a
     different model or prediction set, allowing for simultaneous
     evaluation.

With these concepts in mind, let's explore several practical applications
and gallery examples.

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.taylor_diagram.plot_taylor_diagram` is a basic 
form. It is a more standard Taylor Diagram layout without
background shading, focusing purely on the positions of the model
points relative to the reference. Uses a half-circle layout (90
degrees, showing positive correlations only) with default West
orientation for Corr=1.

   :class: hint

   This **basic Taylor Diagram** presents a clean comparison of model
   skill without background shading, using a 90-degree arc
   (``acov='half_circle'``) focused on positive correlations. Perfect
   correlation (1.0) is on the left (West axis, ``zero_location='W'``),
   and correlation decreases clockwise (``direction=-1``).

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Reference Arc:** The red arc shows the standard deviation of
     the reference data (approx. 1.0).
   * **Model Positions:**
   
     * **Model A** (Red Dot): High correlation (small angle relative
       to West axis), standard deviation below the reference arc
       (~0.8). Underestimates variability.
     * **Model B** (Blue Dot): Lower correlation (larger angle),
       standard deviation above the reference arc (~1.2).
       Overestimates variability and has poorer pattern match.
     * **Model C** (Green Dot): Highest correlation (smallest angle),
       standard deviation almost exactly on the reference arc (~1.0).
       Best overall model in this comparison.
   * **RMSD:** Model C is closest to the reference point (at radius
     ~1.0 on the West axis), indicating the lowest centered RMS
     difference. Model B is furthest away.

   **ðŸ’¡ When to Use:**

   * Use this basic plot for a clear, uncluttered view focused purely
     on the standard deviation and correlation metrics.
   * Ideal when comparing many models where background shading might
     become too busy.
   * Suitable for publications preferring a standard, minimalist
     Taylor Diagram representation.

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.taylor_diagram.taylor_diagram` is a variant 
of a series of Taylor diagrams implemented by ``k-diagram``. It
shows its flexibility by accepting raw data arrays and adding a
background colormap based on the 'rwf' (Radial Weighting Function)
strategy, emphasizing points with good correlation and reference-like
standard deviation.

.. topic:: ðŸ§  Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   The **Taylor Diagram** summarizes model skill by plotting
   standard deviation (radius) vs. correlation (angle) relative
   to a reference (red marker/arc at reference std dev = 1.0,
   angle = 0). Points closer to the reference point indicate
   better overall performance (lower centered RMSD).

   This implementation uses the **Radial Weighting Function (RWF)**
   strategy for the background colormap (normalized blues).

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Reference Point:** The red marker at radius ~1.0 on the
     horizontal axis represents the reference data's variability.
   * **Background (RWF):** Darker blue shades highlight regions
     with both high correlation (small angle) and standard
     deviation close to the reference (radius near 1.0).
   * **Model Performance:**

     * **Model A** (Red Dot): High correlation (~0.85), slightly
       low std dev (~0.8). Good pattern match, slightly low variability.
     * **Model B** (Blue Dot): Low correlation (~0.5), high std
       dev (~1.2). Poor pattern match and wrong variability.
     * **Model C** (Green Dot): Very high correlation (~0.95),
       std dev very close to reference (~1.0). Best overall fit,
       landing in the darkest blue region.

   **ðŸ’¡ When to Use:**

   * Use this plot (`taylor_diagram`) when you need flexibility:
     you can provide pre-calculated stats or raw data.
   * The background (`cmap` + `radial_strategy`) adds context.
     'rwf' specifically helps identify models that match both
     correlation *and* standard deviation well.
   * Ideal for comparing multiple models against observations in
     fields like climate science or hydrology.

The :func:`~kdiagram.plot.taylor_diagram.plot_taylor_diagram_in` is an alternative 
plot with background shaing focus. It highlights the background colormap  feature, 
using the 'convergence' strategy where color intensity relates directly to the
correlation coefficient. It also demonstrates changing the plot
orientation (Corr=1 at North, angles increase counter-clockwise).

.. topic:: ðŸ§  Analysis and Interpretation
   :class: hint

   This version (`plot_taylor_diagram_in`) emphasizes the
   **background color map** and offers flexible **orientation**.
   Here, the background uses the `viridis` colormap with the
   `'convergence'` strategy, meaning color directly maps to the
   correlation value (yellow = high, purple = low). The plot is
   oriented with perfect correlation (1.0) at the top ('N').

   **Analysis and Interpretation:**

   * **Orientation:** Correlation decreases as the angle increases
     counter-clockwise from the top 'N' position. Standard
     deviation increases radially outwards. The red reference arc is
     at radius ~1.0.
   * **Background (Convergence):** The yellow region near the top
     indicates correlations close to 1.0. Colors shift towards
     green/blue/purple as correlation decreases (angle increases).
   * **Model Performance:**
   
     * **Model A** (Red Dot): Good correlation (in greenish-yellow
       zone), std dev slightly below reference arc.
     * **Model B** (Blue Dot): Low correlation (in blue/purple
       zone), std dev slightly above reference arc.
     * **Model C** (Green Dot): Excellent correlation (in bright
       yellow zone), std dev very close to reference arc.

   **ðŸ’¡ When to Use:**

   * Choose `plot_taylor_diagram_in` when you want a strong visual
     guide for correlation levels provided by the background shading.
   * Useful for presentations where the background color helps direct
     the audience's focus to high-correlation regions.
   * Use the orientation options (`zero_location`, `direction`) to
     match specific conventions or visual preferences.

Practical Application: Evaluating Climate Models
---------------------------------------------------------------
A primary and classic use of Taylor Diagrams is in climate science for
evaluating the performance of Global Climate Models (GCMs). A research
group might want to assess how well several competing GCMs reproduce
the historical seasonal cycle of surface temperatures for a critical
region, like the Amazon basin.

The diagram allows them to see, in a single glance, not just which model
is "best," but to diagnose the specific nature of each model's errors.
Does a model capture the timing of the seasons correctly (good
correlation) but get the magnitude wrong (incorrect standard
deviation)? Or does it have the right amount of variability but at the
wrong times?

Let's simulate this scenario with one set of observations and three
different models.

.. admonition:: Practical Example

   A team of climatologists is faced with a critical task: validating a new
   generation of Global Climate Models (GCMs). Before these computationally
   expensive models can be trusted to project future climate scenarios, they
   must first prove their ability to accurately reproduce the known climate
   of the past. A simple error score is insufficient; the team needs to
   understand the *nature* of each model's biases.
   The team chooses to focus on a critical and sensitive region: the Amazon
   basin. Their goal is to assess how well three competing GCMs simulate the
   historical seasonal cycle of monthly surface temperatures. The key
   scientific questions are:

   1.  Does the model correctly capture the **timing** of the seasons
       (the pattern, measured by correlation)?
   2.  Does the model correctly capture the **intensity** of the seasons
       (the magnitude of temperature swings, measured by standard
       deviation)?
   3.  Which model provides the best overall fidelity to the observed
       climate record?

A Taylor Diagram is the ideal tool for this multi-faceted evaluation,
as it can represent all three statistics in a single, concise plot.

To perform this comparative analysis, the team's workflow is simulated
in the following code. First, a synthetic "observed" temperature record
is created, representing the known seasonal cycle. Then, outputs from
three different models are generated, each with a distinct performance
profile: one that is well-calibrated, one that dampens the seasonal
swings, and one that exaggerates them. Finally, these datasets are
plotted on a Taylor Diagram.

   The Taylor Diagrams provide a visual verdict on each model's
   performance, allowing for a clear diagnosis of their specific
   strengths and weaknesses. The left panel shows the standard plot, while
   the right panel adds a background field where brightness corresponds
   to higher correlation, visually guiding the eye to the best-performing
   regions.

   * **Reference (Ground Truth):** The red arc represents the "ground
     truth"â€”the standard deviation of the observed historical
     temperatures (approx. 2.5). The ideal model would lie exactly where
     this arc intersects the horizontal axis.
   * **Model A (Good):** This point is the clear winner. It sits closest to
     the reference point, indicating the lowest overall error (CRMSD). Its
     position reveals a **near-perfect correlation (R > 0.98)**, meaning
     it correctly captures the *phenology* (timing) of the seasons. Its
     radial distance is almost exactly on the red arc, showing it also
     reproduces the correct **amplitude** (intensity) of temperature
     swings. In the right-hand plot, it falls squarely in the brightest
     "hotspot," visually confirming its superior performance.
   * **Model B (Dampened):** This model is diagnosed as "sluggish." It has
     a significantly lower correlation **(R â‰ˆ 0.8)** and its radial distance
     **(Std. Dev. â‰ˆ 1.5)** is far inside the reference arc. This tells
     us the model fails on two fronts: it struggles with the seasonal
     timing and **severely underestimates climate variability**.
   * **Model C (Exaggerated):** This model is "overly sensitive." It
     achieves a high correlation **(R â‰ˆ 0.95)**, correctly simulating the
     seasonal *timing*. However, its point lies far outside the reference
     arc **(Std. Dev. â‰ˆ 3.5)**, indicating its **variability is too high**.
     The model exaggerates the seasonal cycle, a significant bias that
     could stem from flawed feedback mechanisms.

   In conclusion, the diagram provides a definitive report. The team can
   confidently select **Model A** for future projections. More
   importantly, they can provide specific, actionable feedback to the
   developers of the other models: Model B's core issue is its weak
   amplitude and poor timing, while Model C's primary flaw is its
   excessive amplitude.
