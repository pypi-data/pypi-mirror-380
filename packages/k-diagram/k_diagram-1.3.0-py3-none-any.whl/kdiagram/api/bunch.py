class Bunch(dict):
    """Dictionary-like container providing attribute-style access.

    Acts as a standard Python dictionary but allows accessing keys as
    attributes for convenience, similar to structures used in libraries
    like scikit-learn for holding datasets or results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *args : tuple
        Arguments passed directly to the `dict` constructor. Allows
        initialization from mapping objects or iterables of key-value
        pairs.
    **kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments passed directly to the `dict` constructor.
        Allows initialization using key=value pairs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from kdiagram.bunch import Bunch
    >>> b = Bunch(a=1, b='hello')
    >>> b.a
    1
    >>> b['b']
    'hello'
    >>> b.c = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> b['c']

class FlexDict(dict):
    """
    A `FlexDict` is a dictionary subclass that provides flexible attribute-style
    access to its items, allowing users to interact with the dictionary as if it
    were a regular object with attributes. It offers a convenient way to work with
    dictionary keys without having to use the bracket notation typically required by
    dictionaries in Python. This makes it especially useful in environments where
    quick and easy access to data is desired.

    The `FlexDict` class extends the built-in `dict` class, so it inherits all the
    methods and behaviors of a standard dictionary. In addition to the standard
    dictionary interface, `FlexDict` allows for the setting, deletion, and access
    of keys as if they were attributes, providing an intuitive and flexible
    interface for managing dictionary data.

    Examples
    --------
    Here is how you can use a `FlexDict`:

    >>> from kdiagram.api.bunch import FlexDict
    >>> fd = FlexDict(pkg='gofast', goal='simplify tasks', version='1.0')
    >>> fd['pkg']  # Standard dictionary access
    'gofast'
    >>> fd.pkg     # Attribute access
    'gofast'
    >>> fd.goal    # Another example of attribute access
    'simplify tasks'
    >>> fd.version # Accessing another attribute
    '1.0'
    >>> fd.new_attribute = 'New Value'  # Setting a new attribute
    >>> fd['new_attribute']             # The new attribute is accessible as a key
    'New Value'

    Notes
    -----
    - While `FlexDict` adds convenience, it is important to avoid key names that
      clash with the methods and attributes of a regular dictionary. Such conflicts
      can result in unexpected behavior, as method names would take precedence over
      key names during attribute access.

    - The behavior of `FlexDict` under serialization (e.g., when using pickle) may
      differ from that of a standard dictionary due to the attribute-style access.
      Users should ensure that serialization and deserialization processes are
      compatible with `FlexDict`'s approach to attribute access.

    - Since `FlexDict` is built on the Python dictionary, it maintains the same
      performance characteristics for key access and management. However, users
      should be mindful of the additional overhead introduced by supporting
      attribute access when considering performance-critical applications.

    By providing a dictionary that can be accessed and manipulated as if it were a
    regular object, `FlexDict` offers an enhanced level of usability, particularly
    in situations where the more verbose dictionary syntax might be less desirable.
