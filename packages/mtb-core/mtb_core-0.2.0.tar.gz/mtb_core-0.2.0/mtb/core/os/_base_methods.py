    Add a given path, or list of paths, to Python's sys.path.

    Behavior:
    - If `path` is a list of paths, each one is added recursively.
    - If `path` is an instance of Path, it is resolved to its absolute string representation.

    Uniqueness:
    - The function ensures that no duplicate paths are added, irrespective of case.

    Position:
    - If `prepend` is True, the path is added at the beginning of sys.path.
    - Otherwise, it is added at the end.

    Args:
        path (Union[str, Path, List[Union[str, Path]]]): The path or list of paths to add to sys.path.
        prepend (bool, optional): Whether to add the path at the beginning. Defaults to False.

    Create a backup of a given file, optionally specifying target directory and filename modifiers.

    Location Rules:
    - If `target` is provided, the backup will be created there.
    - Otherwise, if `suffix` or `prefix` are specified, backup is created in `(parent of fp) / (backup_dir) / (prefix)_(stem)_(suffix)`.
    - If neither `target` nor `suffix`/`prefix` are provided, backup is created in `(parent of fp) / (backup_dir) / (stem)_(uuid)`.

    Directory Handling:
    - If the target directory does not exist, it is created.

    Overwrite Rules:
    - If the target backup file already exists, a new backup with a UUID is created alongside it.

    Args:
        fp (Path): The file path of the file to be backed up.
        target (Optional[Path], optional): Explicit target directory for the backup. Defaults to None.
        backup_dir (str, optional): Name of the backup directory if `target` is not specified. Defaults to ".bak".
        suffix (Optional[str], optional): Suffix to append to the backup filename. Defaults to None.
        prefix (Optional[str], optional): Prefix to prepend to the backup filename. Defaults to None.
