Welcome to Adventure Data's python package for doing analysis with data from the Lyte Probe.
The Lyte probe is a smart ski pole designed to measure snow. It measures NIR and Force simultaneously along with
peripheral sensors for calculating distance traveled. This package aims to provide useful function for researchers
using the platform.
