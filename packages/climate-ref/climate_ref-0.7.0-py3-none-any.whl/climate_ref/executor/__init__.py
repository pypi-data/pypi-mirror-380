Execute diagnostics in different environments

We support running diagnostics in different environments, such as locally,
in a separate process, or in a container.
These environments are represented by `climate_ref.executor.Executor` classes.

The simplest executor is the `LocalExecutor`, which runs the diagnostic in the same process.
This is useful for local testing and debugging.
