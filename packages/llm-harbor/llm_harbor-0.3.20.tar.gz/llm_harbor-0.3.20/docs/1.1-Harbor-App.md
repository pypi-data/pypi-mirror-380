Harbor App is a companion application for [Harbor](https://github.com/av/harbor) - a toolkit for running AI locally. It's built on top of functionality provided by the `harbor` CLI and is intended to complement it.

The app provides clean and tasteful UI to aid with workflows associated with running a local AI stack.

- üöÄ Manage Harbor stack and individual services
- üîó Quickly access UI/API of a running service
- ‚öôÔ∏è Manage and switch between different configurations
- üé® Aestetically pleasing UI with plenty of built-in themes

## Demo


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5cd2ef1-3208-400a-8866-7abd85808503

In the demo, Harbor App is used to launch a default stack with [Ollama](./2.2.1-Backend:-Ollama) and [Open WebUI](./2.1.1-Frontend:-Open-WebUI) services. Later, [SearXNG](./2.3.1-Satellite:-SearXNG) is also started, and WebUI can connect to it for the Web RAG right out of the box. After that, [Harbor Boost](./5.2.-Harbor-Boost) is also started and connected to the WebUI automatically to induce more creative outputs. As a final step, Harbor config is adjusted in the App for the [`klmbr`](./5.2.-Harbor-Boost#klmbr---boost-llm-creativity) module in the [Harbor Boost](./5.2.-Harbor-Boost), which makes the output unparsable for the LLM (yet still undetstandable for humans).
