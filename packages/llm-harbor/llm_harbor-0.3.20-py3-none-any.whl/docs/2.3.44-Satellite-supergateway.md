Supergateway runs MCP stdio-based servers over SSE (Server-Sent Events) or WebSockets (WS) with one command. This is useful for remote access, debugging, or connecting to clients when your MCP server only supports stdio.

### Starting

```bash
# [Optional] pre-pull the image
harbor pull supergateway

# Run the service as a CLI
harbor run supergateway --help
```

- Tip: this is a CLI service - `harbor run supergateway` is equivalent to `npx -y supergateway`
- You can use `supergateway` to bridge SSE and stdio-based MCP servers, or use it as a means to launch MCP servers for your own use.

### Configuration

There's no specific configuration for `supergateway`.
