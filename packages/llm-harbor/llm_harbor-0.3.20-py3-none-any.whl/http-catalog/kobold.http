For each step, provide a title that describes what you're doing in that step, along with the content. Decide if you need another step or if you're ready to give the final answer.

USE BEST PRACTICES..\n\nExample of a valid JSON response:\n```json\n{\n    \"title\": \"Identifying Key Information\",\n    \"content\": \"To begin solving this problem, we need to carefully examine the given information and identify the crucial elements that will guide our solution process.
