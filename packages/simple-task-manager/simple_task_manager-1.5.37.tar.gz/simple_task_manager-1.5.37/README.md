# Simple Task Manager (STMGR)

This is a simple task manager to start processes on AWS/Docker or other platforms. The app includes classes to manage tasks on AWS, but you can implement additional handlers dynamically.

You only need to create a class to handle the task that you want to start and register it in a database (DDBB). Below, I'll compare STMGR with Celery (since it's widely used) to explain the key differences and help you make an informed choice. Another good choice is Dramatiq. For a simple comparison between STMGR and Celery check 

## Installation
This project can be installed using pip:

```python
pip install simple-task-manager

```
Or it can be installed directly from git:
pip install git+https://github.com/Fran-4c4/staskmgr


## Usage and requirements
- First you need to configure the minimum parameters in order to run tasks. See  [Configuration](./docs/configuration.md)
- Second you need a database to store configuration and task management. See table creation in folder config\ddbb_script.sql or [Configuration scripts](./docs/configuration_sql.md) Actually only postgresql is suported.

# Adding handlers
In order to manage other types you need to create a class and an entry in DDBB or in your appconfig.json in the section **task_handlers**. When the task is retrieved from DDBB it will look the handler. Below is an example of the Test task handler.

```JSON

"task_handlers": {
    "TEST_MGR": {
      "config": {
        "task_handler": {
          "name": "TestTaskHandler",
          "path": "task_handlers",
          "class": "TestTaskHandler",
          "module": "test_task_handler",
          "launchType": "INTERNAL",
		      "task_next_status":"FINISHED"
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

# Test in local 
Install using pip in your project using the next command and changing x.x.x version.

```console
pip install "path_to_dist/dist/Simple_Task_Manager-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl" 
```
