# FastrAPI ⚡

A blazing-fast web framework that brings Rust performance to Python developers. FastrAPI + Rust = **FastrAPI**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🚀 **Blazing Performance**: Powered by Rust and Axum - up to **88x** faster than *FastAPI*
- 🐍 **Python-First**: Write familiar Python code with zero Rust knowledge required
- 🛡️ **Rock-Solid Types**: Built-in type safety inherited from Rust's robust type system
- ⚡ **Async Native**: Tokio-powered async runtime for maximum concurrency
- 🪶 **Ultra Lightweight**: Minimal runtime overhead with maximum throughput
- 🎯 **Drop-in Replacement**: Compatible with FastAPI's beloved decorator syntax

## Installation

### uv
```bash
uv install fastrapi
```

### pip
```bash
pip install fastrapi
```

## Quick Start

```python
from fastrapi import FastrAPI
app = FastrAPI()

@app.get("/hello")
def hello():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.serve("127.0.0.1", 8080)
```

## Performance
Benchmarks using [k6](https://k6.io/) show it outperforms FastAPI + Uvicorn across multiple worker configurations.

### 🖥️ Test Environment
- **Kernel:** 6.16.8-arch3-1  
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS (16 cores, 4.83 GHz)  
- **Memory:** 15 GB  
- **Load Test:** 20 Virtual Users (VUs), 30s  

### ⚡ Benchmark Results

| Framework                  | Avg Latency (ms) | Requests/sec | **Speed Metric** (req/sec ÷ ms) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **FASTRAPI**               | 2.15            | 8378        | **3897**                      |
| FastAPI + Guvicorn (workers: 1)     | 21.08           | 937         | 44                            |
| FastAPI + Guvicorn (workers: 16)    | 4.84            | 3882        | 802                           |

> **TLDR;** FASTRAPI handles thousands of requests per second with ultra-low latency — making it **~88× faster** than FastAPI + Guvicorn with 1 worker.

## Current Limitations
- Limited validation features compared to FastAPI's Pydantic integration
- Some advanced features are still in development
