# wiim
A Python-based API interface for controlling and communicating with WiiM audio devices

## âœ¨ Introduction

**wiim** is a powerful and user-friendly Python library designed to significantly simplify the integration and control of [WiiM](https://wiimhome.com/) smart audio devices. WiiM devices (built on LinkPlay modules) deliver an immersive musical experience throughout your home with their excellent wireless streaming and multiroom audio capabilities. With **wiim**, you can seamlessly manage your WiiM devices directly from your Python applications.

Whether you need precise control over music playback, synchronization of multiroom groups, or real-time retrieval of playback metadata, **wiim** provides a clean and unified interface. It's the ideal choice for building smart home automations, custom music players, or any Python application requiring interaction with WiiM devices.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

âœ… **Automatic Device Discovery**  
Smartly scans and identifies all WiiM devices on your network, making connection effortless.

âœ… **Comprehensive Playback Control**  
Offers all core functionalities including play, pause, stop, skip tracks, volume adjustment, mute/unmute, shuffle, repeat modes, and input source switching.

âœ… **Rich Metadata Retrieval**  
Get real-time detailed information about the currently playing track, such as title, artist, album, album art URL, and more, helping you create personalized display interfaces.

âœ… **Flexible Group Management**  
Easily create, update, or disband multiroom synchronized playback groups for seamless music across your entire home.

âœ… **High Availability & Stability**  
Built-in error handling and device status monitoring mechanisms ensure your control commands are reliably delivered.

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Start

### Installation

Install the **wiim** library easily via pip:

```bash
pip install wiim
```

### Usage Example

Here's a quick example demonstrating how to connect to and control a WiiM device to play music:

```python
__main__.py
```

**Important Notes for the Example:**
- Starts Zeroconf discovery using AsyncZeroconf with ZeroconfListener to automatically find _linkplay._tcp.local. services broadcasted by WiiM devices on your network.
- Waits a configurable duration (e.g., 5 seconds) using asyncio.sleep() to give Zeroconf time to discover devices on the network.
- Verifies each discovered device by probing common UPnP description URLs like http://<device_ip>/description.xml with verify_wiim_device() to confirm it's a WiiM device.
- Creates a WiimDevice instance for each verified WiiM device and sets up an HTTP API endpoint using WiimApiEndpoint for controlling the device.
- Prints detailed information about each verified device including name, UDN, model, IP address, firmware version, playback status, volume, and current track metadata.
- Cleans up all resources by disconnecting from devices, canceling Zeroconf browsing, and closing aiohttp client sessions after the process completes.
