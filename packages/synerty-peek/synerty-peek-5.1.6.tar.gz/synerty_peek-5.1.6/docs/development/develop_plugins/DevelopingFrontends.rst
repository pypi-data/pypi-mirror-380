Developing With The Frontends
=============================

The Peek Platform is extensible with plugins.
Unlike with the Python code, the frontend code can't be just imported.
The frontend code in the plugins have to be combined into build directories for each service.

This document describes how Peek combines the Frontend / Angular files into build
projects.

The frontends are the Admin, Mobile and Desktop services.

*   Admin builds:

        *   Only a Web app, using @angular/cli

*   Field builds:

        *   A Web app, using @angular/cli

*   Office builds:

        *   An Electron app.
        *   A Web app, using @angular/cli

The platform code for combining the files for the frontends is at:
`<https://bitbucket.org/synerty/peek-platform/src/master/peek_platform/build_frontend/>`_

Combining Files
---------------

The Logic, Office, and Field services prepare the build directories for all the frontends.

Peek originally used symbolic links to integrate the plugins,
this approach become harder and harder to manage with
both cross platform support and increasing complexity of the plugin integrations with
the frontend.

Peek now uses a file copy approach, that is handled by the Logic, Office, and Field services.
There were many things to consider when implementing this code, considerations include:

**Incremental file updates.**
Don't rewrite the file if it hasn't changed. This causes problems with development
tools incorrectly detecting file changes.

**Allow on the fly modifications.**
Peek rewrites parts of the frontend code on the fly.

**Angular Ahead of Time Compilation**. The final nail in the symlink approach was
Angular AoT Compilation support.

**Plugins in node_modules**. Plugins in the frontends can leverage each other.
For example, other plugins can leverage services from :code:`peek_core_user` for user
authentication. To do this, Peek copies files into node_modules.

**End user customisation.**
The ability for the end user to overwrite files with out having to fork plugins, etc.

The file copy process, AKA "prepare" or "Combine", is fairly simple:

#.  Use the list of loaded plugins

#.  Read the :file:`plugin_package.json`

#.  Copy and transform files based on :file:`plugin_package.json` settings.

#.  Create static files for:

    #.  Lazy loading routes for plugins

    #.  Global services from plugins

    #.  Home icon and Menu items

    #.  etc

#.  Compile plugin code copied to node_modules.

#.  Copy required files to the platform directory.

At this point the build directories are prepared and ready to run.

End User Customisations
-----------------------

End users, as in not developers, have the ability to hack the frontends. They may do
this to change text, update icons, branding, etc.

.. note::

    The following directory overlay is for the web app directory.

Peek reads files from either the :file:`~/peek-logic-service.home/frontendSrcOverlayDir`
or :file:`~/peek-office-service.home/frontendSrcOverlayDir` directories and overlays them
on top of the build directories.

This provides end users with the ability to
alter any part of the Electron, Web or Capacitor frontends by copying a file
into the customisation directory and then altering it.

This is a use at their own risk feature.

The following property is present in the Peek Logic, Office, and Field :file:`*-service.home/config.json`
files.

::

        {
            ...
            "frontend": {
                ...
                "frontendSrcOverlayDir": "/home/peek/peek-office-service.home/frontendSrcOverlayDir",
                "frontendNodeModuleOverlayDir": "/home/peek/peek-office-service.home/frontendNodeModuleOverlayDir",
            },
            ...
        }

----

#1 Copy the plugin build directory into the frontend folder

::

    cp -r synerty-peek-1.3.4/lib/python3.6/site-packages/peek_office_app/src/peek_plugin_enmac_diagram peek-office-service.home/frontendSrcOverlayDir/

#2 Remove the files not being updated (weâ€™re updating pofDiagram.component.web.html)

::

    cd peek-office-service.home/frontendSrcOverlayDir/peek_plugin_enmac_diagram/
    rm -rf coord-set/ show-diagram/ *.ts

#3 Edit the file and restart Peek

::

    vi pofDiagram.component.web.html
    p_restart_all.sh

#4 Monitor the logs and refresh Peek Desktop

::

    http://peekserver:8002/peek_plugin_enmac_diagram

# 5 Undo the changes

::

    rm -rf ~/peek-office-service.home/frontendSrcOverlayDir/peek_plugin_enmac_diagram
    p_restart_all.sh

Live Updating for Development
-----------------------------

Both **Capacitor** and **Angular CLI** have development tools that provide live
sync + refresh support.

Meaning, you can alter your code, save, and the tools will recompile, and update the apps.
Angular CLI will update the code for the web page and reload it, Capacitor will
copy the generated bundles to the iOS and Android directories to be used in
xcode and Android Studio.

Peek's frontend preparation code creates maps of where files should be copied from and to,
then monitors all the source directories, and incrementally updates files as the
developer works. This includes performing any on the fly changes to the files that are
required.

To enable file syncing, in file(s)
:file:`~/peek-logic-service.home/config.json` or :file:`~/peek-office-service.home/config.json`
set :code:`frontend.syncFilesForDebugEnabled` to :code:`true` and restart the appropriate service.

You may also want to disable the web building. This isn't required for the Angular CLI
development server and it slows down Peek Logic, Office, and Field restarts.
Set :code:`frontend.webBuildEnabled` to :code:`false`.


If DEBUG logging is also enabled, you'll see Peek working away when you change files.

::

        {
            ...
            "frontend": {
                ...
                "syncFilesForDebugEnabled": true,
                "webBuildEnabled": false,
                ....
            },
            "logging": {
                "level": "DEBUG"
            },
            ...
        }

Now when you run: ::

        # Start Angular CLI live dev server
        npm start

The web apps will automatically update as the developer changes things.


build-web
`````````

To build the dist dir, and serve it on a normal port run: ::

        ng build -w


The :code:`-w` option listens for changes.

To run the packages start scripts run: ::

        npm start


Auto refreshes, deletes the dist that ng build creates, and the proxy settings for file resources and http vortex.

Developing on iOS Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before Peek can be deployed the signing certificate must be transfered to the device using Xcode.

To develop with iOS you'll need a developer account on https://developer.apple.com

Troubleshooting
---------------


OSError: inotify instance limit reached
```````````````````````````````````````

If you receive an error when starting the Peek Logic, Office, and Field services on Linux, stating
:code:`OSError: inotify instance limit reached`, running the following command may
solve the issue. ::

    sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=200000


Otherwise, try rebooting.
