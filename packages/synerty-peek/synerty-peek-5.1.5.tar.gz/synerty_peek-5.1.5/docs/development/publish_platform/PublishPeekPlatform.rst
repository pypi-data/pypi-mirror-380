Publish Peek Platform
=====================

Building a Production Release
-----------------------------

The peek package has build scripts that generate a platform build

----

Open the command prompt and enter the bash shell

----

Change root directory of synerty-peek, example:

::

        cd ~peek/dev-peek/peek/


----

Check and take note of synerty-peek's latest release version on
`pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/synerty-peek/>`_

----

Run the follow command being sure to increment the version number:

::

        ./publish_platform.sh #.#.##


.. note:: Prod build, it tags, commits and test uploads to
    `testpypi <https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/synerty-peek>`_.

----

Run the following script to upload the new release to
`pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/synerty-peek/>`_:

::

        ./pypi_upload.sh


Building a Development Release
------------------------------

The peek package has build scripts that generate a development build

----

Open the command prompt and enter the bash shell

----

Change root directory of synerty-peek, example:

::

        cd ~peek/dev-peek/synerty-peek/


----

Run the follow command being sure to increment the version number:

::

        ./publish_platform.sh #.#.#.dev#


.. note:: Dev build, it doesn't tag, commit or test upload, but still generates a build.

.. warning:: Omitting the dot before dev will cause the script to fail as setuptools
    adds the dot in if it's not there, which means the cp commands won't match files.
