v3.1.x Release Notes
====================

Platform Changes
----------------
Peek v3.1.0 is largely a stability and quality of life update. Few new features
have been added, as the focus has been on finding and fixing any pain points
or errors present after the major upgrades made in Peek 3.0.

One new feature that was added to Peek v3.1.0 is an improved API for GPS
support.

Peek now includes Capacitor v3.5.

Arrays of PayloadEnvelopes are now supported.

Major Plugin Changes
--------------------
We specifically avoided making any major changes to existing plugins in this
release. One new plugin was created and is expected to improve an expand GPS
usage in Peek significantly in future releases.

Deployment Changes
------------------
Deployment of the Peek platform now builds several prerequisites from source,
as opposed to using a package manager,
resulting in an equivalent installation across all supported platforms.

Windows Deployment
``````````````````

.. note:: This release is not supported on Windows.

Linux Deployment
````````````````

Deployment for Linux remains the same after the major changes of Peek v3.0.

Debian: :ref:`debian_install_prerequisites`

Redhat: :ref:`rhel_install_prerequisites`

macOS Deployment
````````````````

Deployment for macOS remains the same after the major changes of Peek v3.0.

MacOS: :ref:`macos_install_prerequisites`



Windows Deployment
``````````````````

Nil.

.. note:: The windows deployment will change to use Windows Subsystem for Linux
          in a future release.

Migration Steps
---------------

Restart peek-field-service and peek-office-service after the initial load has
completed. This is due to issue PEEK-1149: Devices tab not appearing in Peek
DMS Search
