# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`awsquery` is an advanced CLI tool for querying AWS APIs through boto3 with flexible filtering, automatic parameter resolution, and comprehensive security validation. The tool enforces ReadOnly AWS operations for security and provides intelligent response processing with automatic field discovery.

## Development Philosophy

**CRITICAL: ZERO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENT**

This project has **ZERO EXTERNAL CONSUMERS** and **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY OBLIGATIONS**. Internal APIs can and should be changed aggressively for code quality improvements.

**MANDATORY PRINCIPLES:**
- **NEVER maintain backward compatibility** - there are no external users
- **CLI commands must remain stable** - user-facing behavior should be consistent
- **Internal APIs are completely mutable** - change function signatures, parameters, return types freely
- **Delete deprecated code immediately** - no deprecation periods needed
- **Refactor aggressively** - prioritize clean code over any compatibility concerns
- **Break internal interfaces without hesitation** - improve designs whenever beneficial
- **Update tests to match new APIs** - test failures from API changes should be fixed by updating tests

**The only stability requirement is the CLI user experience. All internal code is fair game for radical changes.**

## MANDATORY AGENT USAGE

## Architecture

### Core Module Structure
- `src/awsquery/cli.py` - Main CLI interface and argument parsing
- `src/awsquery/core.py` - Core AWS query execution logic
- `src/awsquery/security.py` - Security policy validation (ReadOnly enforcement)
- `src/awsquery/filters.py` - Data filtering and column selection logic
- `src/awsquery/formatters.py` - Output formatting (table/JSON)
- `src/awsquery/utils.py` - Utility functions and debug helpers

### Key Features
- **Smart Multi-Level Calls**: Automatically resolves missing parameters by inferring list operations
- **Security-First Design**: All operations validated against `policy.json` ReadOnly policy
- **Flexible Filtering**: Multi-level filtering with `--` separators for different filter types
- **Auto-Parameter Resolution**: Handles both specific fields and standard AWS patterns (Name, Id, Arn)
- **Intelligent Response Processing**: Clean extraction of list data, ignoring AWS metadata

### Security Architecture
The tool enforces security through a comprehensive `policy.json` file that defines allowed ReadOnly AWS operations. All API calls are validated against this policy before execution.

### Testing Structure
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/` with `@pytest.mark.unit`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` with `@pytest.mark.integration`
- Critical path tests marked with `@pytest.mark.critical`
- AWS mocks using moto library marked with `@pytest.mark.aws`

### STRICT Testing Requirements - MUST FOLLOW

#### 🚫 PROHIBITED: Test Anti-Patterns
**NEVER CREATE:**
1. **Duplicate Test Files**: Before creating ANY test file, search for existing tests covering the same functionality
   - Flag tests: Use `test_cli_flags.py` ONLY
   - Parser tests: Use `test_cli_parser.py` ONLY
   - Filter tests: Use `test_filter_implementation.py` for real tests, `test_filter_matching.py` for patterns
2. **Over-Mocked Tests**: Tests that mock the very functions they claim to test
3. **Mock Assertion Tests**: Tests that only verify `mock.assert_called()` without testing actual behavior
4. **Nested Mock Contexts**: More than 2 levels of `with patch()` indicates over-mocking

#### ✅ REQUIRED: Test Best Practices
**ALWAYS:**
1. **Test Real Implementation**:
   ```python
   # GOOD: Tests actual function
   result = filter_resources(real_data, ["filter"])
   assert len(result) == expected

   # BAD: Only tests mock
   mock_filter.return_value = []
   mock_filter.assert_called_once()
   ```

2. **Minimal Mocking**: Only mock external dependencies (boto3, file I/O, network)
   ```python
   # GOOD: Only mock AWS
   @patch("boto3.client")
   def test_feature(mock_client):
       # Test real code with mocked AWS

   # BAD: Mock everything
   @patch("filter_resources")
   @patch("format_output")
   @patch("parse_args")
   ```

3. **Consolidate Related Tests**: Group similar tests in one file
   - All flag position tests → `test_cli_flags.py`
   - All parser tests → `test_cli_parser.py`
   - All filter implementation → `test_filter_implementation.py`

4. **Test Edge Cases**: Include malformed input, Unicode, empty values
   ```python
   # Test edge cases
   test_cases = ["", None, "^$", "ˆ", "$^", "^^$$"]
   ```

5. **Verify Actual Output**: Check real results, not mock calls
   ```python
   # GOOD: Verify actual JSON
   output = format_json_output(data, filters)
   parsed = json.loads(output)  # Ensures valid JSON

   # BAD: Only check mock called
   mock_json.assert_called_once()
   ```

#### 📋 Test Review Checklist
Before committing ANY test:
1. ❓ Does a test file for this feature already exist?
2. ❓ Am I testing real code or just mocks?
3. ❓ Do assertions verify actual behavior?
4. ❓ Is mocking limited to external dependencies only?
5. ❓ Are edge cases covered?

#### 🔍 Finding Duplicate Tests
```bash
# Check for existing tests before creating new ones
grep -r "test.*flag.*position" tests/
grep -r "test.*parser" tests/
grep -r "test.*filter" tests/
```

### 🚫 **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: VERBOSE TEST COMMENTS**

**MANDATORY EDICT: UNNECESSARY TEST COMMENTS ARE CATEGORICALLY FORBIDDEN**

**NEVER WRITE THESE TYPES OF COMMENTS:**
- **TDD Placeholder Comments**: `"""Test the expected structure when -i/--input is implemented."""`
- **Obvious Restatements**: `"""Test that function returns expected value."""`
- **Implementation Descriptions**: `"""This test checks if the parser works correctly."""`
- **Future Implementation Notes**: `"""TODO: implement when feature X is ready."""`
- **Verbose Process Descriptions**: `"""First we call X, then we check Y, finally we assert Z."""`

**HARD RULES FOR TEST DOCUMENTATION:**
- **NO REDUNDANT DOCSTRINGS**: Never restate what the method name already says
- **NO TDD PLACEHOLDERS**: Delete placeholder comments immediately after implementation
- **NO OBVIOUS COMMENTS**: If the test name explains it, don't repeat in comments
- **NO VERBOSE EXPLANATIONS**: Code should be self-documenting
- **ESSENTIAL ONLY**: Comments only for complex edge cases or non-obvious logic

**ACCEPTABLE COMMENTS (RARE):**
- Complex edge case explanation: `# Unicode circumflex U+02C6 vs ASCII U+005E`
- Non-obvious assertion: `# Must check stderr, not stdout for debug output`
- External dependency note: `# Requires specific AWS policy format`

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- **IMMEDIATE DELETION** of any TDD placeholder comments
- **ZERO TOLERANCE** for verbose test documentation
- **CLEAN CODE OVER COMMENTS** - make tests readable through naming and structure

### 🚫 **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION: PYTEST MARKERS**

**MANDATORY EDICT: PYTEST MARKERS ARE CATEGORICALLY FORBIDDEN AND COMPLETELY BANNED**

**UNBREAKABLE RULES:**
- **NEVER, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES** add `@pytest.mark.*` decorators to tests
- **ZERO TOLERANCE** for selective test execution markers (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, `@pytest.mark.slow`, `@pytest.mark.critical`, etc.)
- **ALL TESTS MUST ALWAYS RUN** - no exceptions, no conditional execution, no selective filtering
- **IMMEDIATE DELETION** required for any pytest markers discovered in code
- **NO EXEMPTIONS** - this rule is immutable and non-negotiable

**RATIONALE:**
- Selective test execution leads to **INCOMPLETE COVERAGE** and **HIDDEN FAILURES**
- Markers create **FALSE CONFIDENCE** by allowing tests to be skipped
- **ALL TESTS ARE CRITICAL** - none should be optional or conditional
- Complete test suite execution is **MANDATORY FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE**

**ENFORCEMENT:**
- Any pytest markers found in code must be **REMOVED IMMEDIATELY**
- Makefile commands must **NEVER USE** `-m "marker"` syntax
- Test discovery must be **PURELY DIRECTORY-BASED** (tests/unit/, tests/integration/)
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** - this is an inviolable principle

**ALLOWED:** `@pytest.mark.parametrize` ONLY (for test parameterization, not selection)
**FORBIDDEN:** All other `@pytest.mark.*` decorators without exception
