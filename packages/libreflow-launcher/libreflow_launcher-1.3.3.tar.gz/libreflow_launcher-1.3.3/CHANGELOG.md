### Changed

* `KABARET_FLOW_EXT_INSTALLERS` environment variable is no longer used if there is no extensions assigned to a project.
* The launcher now uses the direct path for python. Especially for using the correct version selected in the settings.
* Poetry path is no longer used. Instead, it calls the Python module to ensure that the correct one is used according to the Python version.
* In the settings, the Python path parameter is now a list and you can add a custom path.
* Checking the Poetry environment of a project has been improved.
  * It makes sure it uses the correct Python version selected in the settings, and that all dependencies are installed.

Initial public commit and pypi setup. This is an early version of Libreflow Launcher.

The user interface is likely to change in the future.
