# OID and TID data structures.
#
# The cache MVCC implementation depends on the map types being atomic
# for primitive operations, so don't accept Python BTree
# implementations. (Also, on PyPy, the Python BTree implementation
# uses more memory than a dict.)
#
# The map types are rarely large, but they could sometimes be.
# The set types are more likely to be large (e.g., a set is used to hold
# all the OIDs we need to poll after reading from a persistent cache).
#
# Importantly: The BTree multiunion() operation is by far at its most
# efficient when they operate on either Set or Bucket objects *not*
# BTree or TreeSet objects, and not subclasses of any of those. For
# combining ~700 Maps or Buckets, using Buckets is nearly 50% faster
# (55s vs 28s).
#
# That said, we now have our own Map and Set implementation in
# ``_inthashmap`` that is based on ``boost::unordered_map``; instead of
# being ``O(log n)`` for access, it's ``O(1)``. It's based on multiple
# buckets, so it uses about the same amount of memory as a BTree does, but
# is generally faster. We use it everywhere.

    # For BTree and Tree set objects, if you subclass you can define two attributes
    # to customize their allocation (simplified):
    #
    # - ``max_internal_size`` is the number of buckets the root BTree
    # is allowed to hold before it splits. (Actually, it goes to twice
    # that size before it splits.) Each time it needs to resize its
    # internal array, it doubles. In the C code, the default for this
    # is DEFAULT_MAX_BTREE_SIZE == 500.
    #
    # - ``max_leaf_size`` is how big (strictly) a bucket is allowed to
    # be before *it* splits. Buckets start out by allocating an array
    # of size 16 and they double their allocation each time they have
    # to grow. Unfortunately there's no way to give them a suggested
    # size and have them allocate that. In the C code, the default for
    # this is DEFAULT_MAX_BUCKET_SIZE == 120
    #
    # Since these are only in-memory, there's no real downside to
    # increasing them all substantially; it will result in larger
    # memory allocations and better memory locality. The algorithms
    # are still logarithmic (and actually creation and lookups
    # benchmark slightly faster for larger values). The only time that
    # could be a problem is if they're *very* large, then the amount
    # of waste could be substantial. Choose values one less than a
    # power of two to avoid that last huge allocation.
    #
    # Using these values and an OidSet of about 800,000 objects (from

# Observations:
# - Large list() is faster to create on CPython 2, but uses 4x the memory.
# - Large list() is *slower* to create on CPython 3 and uses an incredible
#    9x the memory. Relative to Python 2, I suspect the differences have to do with
#    all Python 3 integers being variable-length long objects, unlike Python 2.
#    I suspect that accounts for much of the difference in general.
# - PyPy memory usage is comparable for both list and array (which makes sense, it has
#    a specialized strategy for lists of integers), but large lists are faster to
#    create for some reason.
# - Creation times for small sets is basically the same on all platforms.
# - Slicing time of arrays is faster on CPython 2 and 3 but much slower on PyPy.
# - Iterating arrays is substantially slower on all platforms and for all sizes.
# - However, creating arrays is faster than creating 64-bit TreeSets; iteration
#   is about the same.
#
# Conclusions:
# Except on PyPy, when working with a large list of OIDs, a 64-bit array.array
# will save a substantial amount of memory. On Python 3, it will probably be slightly
# faster to create too; on both Python 2 and 3 it will be faster and smaller than an equivalent
# TreeSet. Slicing is faster with arrays as well. Iteration is around 3x slower, but that's likely
# to be noise compared to the body of the loop.
# Thus, everywhere except PyPy, if we have an unsigned 64-bit array.array available, that should
# be our choice.
