.. tip::

   Prior to version 3.5.0a4, using ZODB's ``readCurrent(ob)`` method
   will result in taking shared locks (``SELECT FOR SHARE``) in
   PostgreSQL for the row holding the data for *ob*.

   This operation performs disk I/O, and consequently has an
   associated cost. We recommend using this method judiciously.
