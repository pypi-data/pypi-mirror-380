This repository makes a minor change in the scikit-learn library. Our change is limited by the additional functionality that the class LinearSVC solver now reveals the learned dual variables to the user. In all other aspects the code is identical to sklearn version 1.6.dev0. All licenses and rights belong to the original authors of scikit-learn. Please refer to the COPYING file for more details.
