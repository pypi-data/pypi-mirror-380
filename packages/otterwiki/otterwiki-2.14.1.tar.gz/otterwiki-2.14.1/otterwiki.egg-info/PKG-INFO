# An Otter Wiki

An Otter Wiki is Python-based software for collaborative content
management, called a [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki). The
content is stored in a git repository, which keeps track of all changes.
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) is used as
Markup language. An Otter Wiki is written in [python](https://www.python.org/)
using the microframework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
[halfmoon](https://www.gethalfmoon.com) is used as CSS framework
and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) as editor.
[Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/license/free) serves the icons.

## Notable Features

- Minimalistic interface (with dark-mode)
- Editor with markdown highlighting and support including tables
- Customizable Sidebar: Menu and/or Page Index
- Full changelog and page history
- User authentication
- Page Attachments
- Extended Markdown: tables, footnotes, fancy blocks, alerts and mermaid diagrams
- (experimental) Git http server: clone, pull and push the content of your wiki
- A very cute Otter as logo (drawn by [Christy Presler](http://christypresler.com/) CC BY 3.0)
