## Welcome to your wiki!

Your Otter Wiki is up and running.

This is your [[Home]] Page, the first page you see when you access your
wiki.

The first steps you might want to do:

1. [Register an account](/-/register). The very first account is an
   admin account which is able to configure the wiki.
2. Check the [configuration](/-/admin#application_preferences) of your wiki.
   You can change its name, configure the permissions necessary to
   view and edit pages or upload attachments.
3. If you require users to confirm their email address (recommended),
   make sure that you will configure and test your [Email Preferences](/-/admin#mail_preferences).
4. [Edit your Home](/Home/edit)! Do not like the change? Visit the
   page [history](/Home/history) and revert any change ever made.
5. You can [attach](/Home/attachments) images and other files to any page
   and then display them and link to them inside the page.
6. [Create new pages](/-/create)! If you need help with the Markdown syntax,
   check out the [Markdown guide](/-/help/syntax).
7. Read the [user guide](/-/help) and learn about An Otter Wikis features.

We hope that An Otter Wiki is just what you are looking for.
If you have any suggestions, feature requests or run into any
issues, please reach out and report them
via [github](https://github.com/redimp/otterwiki/issues).
