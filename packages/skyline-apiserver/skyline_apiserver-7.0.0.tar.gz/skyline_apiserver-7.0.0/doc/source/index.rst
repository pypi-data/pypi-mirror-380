Skyline APIServer (API of OpenStack Modern Dashboard)
=====================================================

Introduction
============

.. image:: images/logo/skyline.png

OpenStack `Skyline APIServer <https://github.com/openstack/skyline-apiserver>`_
is the back-end server of Skyline. It provides RESTful APIs to `Skyline Console
<https://github.com/openstack/skyline-console>`_.

Skyline is an OpenStack dashboard optimized by UI and UE, support OpenStack
Train+. It has a modern technology stack and ecology, is easier for developers
to maintain and operate by users, and has higher concurrency performance.

Skyline's mascot is the nine-color deer. The nine-color deer comes from
Dunhuang mural “the nine-color king deer”, whose moral is Buddhist
cause-effect and gratefulness, which is consistent with 99cloud's
philosophy of embracing and feedback community since its inception. We
also hope Skyline can keep light, elegant and powerful as the nine-color
deer, to provide a better dashboard for the openstack community and
users.
