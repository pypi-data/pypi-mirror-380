# GPU Implementation Fixes for QuantRS2

## Fixed Issues

1. **Missing Module Structure** - Created a proper `simulator.rs` module with shared traits and types
   - Added `SimulatorResult<N>` struct with amplitudes and helper methods
   - Added `Simulator` trait with `run<const N: usize>()` method
   - Updated `lib.rs` to export the new module in prelude

2. **Import Path Updates** - Fixed outdated import paths in `gpu.rs`:
   - Updated `quantrs_circuit` to `quantrs2_circuit`
   - Updated `quantrs_core` to `quantrs2_core`

3. **Missing Types and Functions** - Added necessary types:
   - Created our own `GateType` enum for GPU implementation
   - Added gate conversion logic in the `run()` method

4. **API Updates** - Fixed API compatibility issues:
   - Updated `wgpu::Maintain::Wait` to `wgpu::MaintainBase::Wait` for newer wgpu versions
   - Added proper gate extraction from quantum circuit

5. **Dependencies** - Added missing dependencies:
   - Added `tokio` dependency for async runtime
   - Updated feature flags to include the needed dependencies

6. **Build Process** - Improved the build script:
   - Added macOS-specific environment variables for Apple Silicon
   - Added debug build step to catch errors earlier
   - Added better error handling and reporting

## Using the Updated GPU Implementation

To build with GPU support, run:

```bash
cd $quantrs/py
./build_with_gpu.sh
```

To test if GPU support is working:

```bash
python gpu_test.py
```

## Implementation Details

The GPU implementation now extracts gate information from the circuit and converts it to a format suitable for the GPU. For each gate, we:

1. Extract the target qubits
2. Get the gate matrix
3. Convert to our GPU-friendly representation
4. Apply the appropriate GPU shader based on gate type
5. Synchronize the GPU execution
6. Copy results back to CPU memory

For small circuits (less than 4 qubits), we automatically use the CPU implementation since the overhead of GPU computation would outweigh the benefits.

## Further Improvements

Potential future improvements to the GPU implementation:

1. Add support for more gate types directly on the GPU
2. Optimize shader code for better performance
3. Add batched execution for running multiple circuits in parallel
4. Implement Mixed precision for larger circuits (e.g., fp16)
5. Add memory-efficient algorithms for large qubit counts
