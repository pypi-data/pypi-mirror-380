- Limited to specific qubit counts (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16)
- Run method has significant code duplication due to type limitations
- GPU support requires compilation from source with specific flags
- Large memory requirements for simulating many qubits
- Some ML features have placeholder implementations
- ML modules may have performance bottlenecks compared to native code
