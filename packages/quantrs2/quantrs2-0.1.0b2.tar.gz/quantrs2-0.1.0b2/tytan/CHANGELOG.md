## Upgrade Guide

### From 0.1.0-alpha.4 to 0.1.0-alpha.5

The new quantum computing features are additive and don't break existing APIs. To use the new features:

1. **Quantum Neural Networks**:
   ```rust
   use quantrs2_tytan::quantum_neural_networks::{create_qnn_for_optimization};
   ```

2. **Tensor Network Sampler**:
   ```rust
   use quantrs2_tytan::tensor_network_sampler::{create_mps_sampler, TensorNetworkSampler};
   ```

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   ```rust
   use quantrs2_tytan::advanced_performance_analysis::{create_comprehensive_analyzer};
   ```

All existing code will continue to work without modifications.
