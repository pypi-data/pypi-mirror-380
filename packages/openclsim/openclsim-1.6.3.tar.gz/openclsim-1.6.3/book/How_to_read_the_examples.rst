How to read the examples
========================

In the next chapters of this book we introduce OpenCLSim functionality step by step. 
To make the examples easier to follow each example follows the exact same steps:

* Import libraries
* Initialise simpy environment
* Define object classes
* Create objects
   * Create sites
   * Create vessels
   * Create activities
* Register processes and run simpy
* Inspect results

In some examples one or more of these steps may be emtpy, but we maintain the same 
structure nonetheless.
