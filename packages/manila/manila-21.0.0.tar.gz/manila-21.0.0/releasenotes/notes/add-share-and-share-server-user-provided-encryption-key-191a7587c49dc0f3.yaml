    Starting with microversion 2.90, Manila allows end users to provide
    barbican secret_ref as encryption key reference in share create API. This
    will be used as either share encryption key reference or share server
    encryption key reference, based on backend driver support for share
    encryption.
issues:
  - |
    When using share types with ``encryption_support=share_server``, share
    servers created cannot currently be unmanaged from Manila. This limitation
    will be addressed in a future release.

    Additionally, care must be taken when managing existing shares with
    ``driver_handles_share_servers=True`` (DHSS=True). You must use a share type
    that supports encryption if the share must be encrypted or if its existing
    encryption status needs to be retained.
