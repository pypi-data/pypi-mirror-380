    NetApp driver `bug #2029467
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2029467>`_:
    When creating a share from a snapshot, the clone split operation is delayed
    until the share creation is complete. This ensures that the share creation
    operation is not blocked by the clone split operation.
