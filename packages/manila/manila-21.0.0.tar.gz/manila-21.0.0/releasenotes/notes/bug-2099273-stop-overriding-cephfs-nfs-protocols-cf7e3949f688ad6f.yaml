    `Launchpad bug 2099273 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2099273>`
    has been addressed by removing the NFS protocol override within the
    request sent to the Ceph Manager API. This allows users to mount shares
    exported by the Ceph NFS service with any NFS protocol version exposed by
    that service.
