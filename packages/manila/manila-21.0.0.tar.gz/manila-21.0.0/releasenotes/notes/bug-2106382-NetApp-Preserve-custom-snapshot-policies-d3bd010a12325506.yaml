    Netapp ONTAP driver allows to set snapshot policy names that will be kept
    during operations like migration_complete and manage_container, instead of
    overwriting by snapshot policy that is set via share type extra specs.
    Config option 'netapp_volume_snapshot_policy_exceptions' will be used to
    configure exception snapshot policies. For more details, please check
    `Launchpad bug #2106382 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2106382>`_
