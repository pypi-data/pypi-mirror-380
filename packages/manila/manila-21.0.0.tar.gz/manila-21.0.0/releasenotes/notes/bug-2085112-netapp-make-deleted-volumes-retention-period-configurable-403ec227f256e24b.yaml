    The NetApp ONTAP driver now supports user configurable volume delete
    retention period (``netapp_volume_delete_retention_hours``). The max value
    of config option ``unused_share_server_cleanup_interval`` is updated to
    possible max value of retention period because if a share server gets
    deleted, the volume recovery queue also gets purged.
