fixes:
  - |
    When performing a share server migration without new share network,
    reused allocations are properly updated with new share_server_id.
  - |
    In NetApp driver functions related to share server migration,
    vserver_name is now retrieved directly from backend_details instead
    of templating. This way, vserver_name is correct even for share
    servers that have already been migrated once.
