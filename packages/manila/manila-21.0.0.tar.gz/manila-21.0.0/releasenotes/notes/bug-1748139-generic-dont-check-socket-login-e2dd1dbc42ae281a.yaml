    The service instance module, used by some drivers supporting
    `driver_handles_share_servers=True` mode, now checks for login
    instead of polling the SSH port for connectivity. This is expected
    to improve robustness of share creation operations that need a new
    share server. See `bug 1748139
    <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1748139>`_ for more details.
