    Added synchronized lock to fix issue where provisioned_capacity_gb value
    was initialized to None immediately on another thread while checking
    capacity filter, causing shared creation to fail due to conflicting
    provisioned_capacity_gb updates.
    please refer to `launchpad bug #1871768 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/1871768>`_.
