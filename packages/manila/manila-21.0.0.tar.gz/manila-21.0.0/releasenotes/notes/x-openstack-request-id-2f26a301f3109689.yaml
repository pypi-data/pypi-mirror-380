    The `request_id` pipeline filter has been added to the `api_paste.ini`
    file. This change ensures that the unique API request ID is returned
    in API response headers through the `x-openstack-request-id` header in
    addition to the `x-openstack-compute-request-id` header. This change
    ensures consistency with other OpenStack API services. Operators should
    **update their `api_paste.ini` configuration** to include
    the `request_id` filter in pipelines to take advantage of this
    new behavior.
