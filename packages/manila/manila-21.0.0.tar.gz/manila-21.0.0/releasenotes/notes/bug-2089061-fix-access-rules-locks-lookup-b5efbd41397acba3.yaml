    While displaying and deleting access rules, manila was limiting the search
    for locks to the context of the request. Now, manila will search within
    all of the projects for locks and properly apply visibility and deletion
    restrictions. For more details, please refer to
    `launchpad bug #2089061 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2089061>`_.
