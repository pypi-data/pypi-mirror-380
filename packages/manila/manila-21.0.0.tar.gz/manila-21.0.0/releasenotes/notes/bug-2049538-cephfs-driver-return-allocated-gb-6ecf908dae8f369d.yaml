    Fixed a scheduling issue that affected the CephFS Native and NFS drivers
    when a Ceph storage back end was configured with multiple filesystems. The
    share driver will now provide the necessary information so
    Manila can evenly distribute the shares between the different configured
    storage back ends. For more details, please refer to
    `Launchpad bug #2049538 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2049538>`_.

    A new configuration option named
    ``cephfs_cached_allocated_capacity_update_interval`` has been added to the
    CephFS Native and NFS drivers, so that OpenStack Operators are able to
    define the amount in seconds for the cached allocation capacity gigabytes
    timeout to be renewed. The cache validity is measured by a stop watch
    that is not thread-safe.
