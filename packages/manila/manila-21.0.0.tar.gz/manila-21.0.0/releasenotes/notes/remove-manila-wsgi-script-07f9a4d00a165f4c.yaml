upgrade:
  - |
    The WSGI script ``manila-wsgi`` has been removed. Deployment tooling
    should instead reference the Python module path for the wsgi module in
    Manila, ``manila.wsgi.api:application`` if their chosen WSGI server
    supports this (gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.) or implement a ``.wsgi`` script
    themselves if not (mod_wsgi).
