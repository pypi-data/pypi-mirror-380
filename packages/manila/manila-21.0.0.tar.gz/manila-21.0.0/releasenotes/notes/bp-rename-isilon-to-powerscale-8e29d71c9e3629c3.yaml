    Dell PowerScale Driver was previously the EMC Isilon Driver. If the
    extra-spec``share_backend_name`` was set to ``isilon`` in share types
    in the past, this needs to be changed to ``powerscale``.
    ``emc_share_backend`` configuration option must be switched from
    ``isilon`` to ``powerscale`` in manila.conf when you add the storage
    backend.
