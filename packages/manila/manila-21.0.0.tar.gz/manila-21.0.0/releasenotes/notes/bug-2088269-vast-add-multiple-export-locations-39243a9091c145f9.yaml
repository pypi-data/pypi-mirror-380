    `Launchpad bug #2037422 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/manila/+bug/2088269>`_:
    Fixed an issue within the VASTData driver that made only one export path
    available for mounting, regardless if more mount paths were available. Now,
    the amount of export locations will correspond to the way the storage is
    configured for better load balancing.
