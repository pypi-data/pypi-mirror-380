question: |
  Please tell me what you think.
fields:
  - "Select the fruits you like": likes_fruit
    datatype: checkboxes
    code: |
      [
        {'apple': 'Apples'},
        {'peach': 'Peaches'},
        {'pear': 'Pears'}
      ]
  - "What is your favorite fruit overall?": favorite_fruit

question: |
  Thank you for your thoughts.
subquestion: |
  % if likes_fruit['apple']:
  You like apples.
  % endif
  % if likes_fruit['peach']:
  You like peaches.
  % endif
  % if likes_fruit['pear']:
  You like pears.
  % endif

  In other words, you like
  ${ likes_fruit.true_values() }.

  Your favorite, though, is ${ favorite_fruit }.

  In Python, `likes_fruit` is a `DADict`:
  `${ repr(likes_fruit) }`.
mandatory: True
