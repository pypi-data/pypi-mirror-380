question: |
  Introduction to vegetables
subquestion: |
  Note that the `code` block action we are in right now will not be
  over unless `vegetable_intro` and `favorite_vegetable` are defined.
  You can refresh the screen now and this screen will appear again.
  Note that `code` blocks with `event` do not behave this way.

question: |
  What is your favorite vegetable?
fields:
  - Favorite vegetable: favorite_vegetable
---
question: |
  What is your favorite legume?
fields:
  - Legume: favorite_legume
---
question: |
  Why do you like ${ favorite_legume }?
subquestion: |
  Note that `legume_rationale` has already been defined by a
  `code` block during this action, but this `question` is
  being asked anyway.

  An `action` will continue past a `code` block that defines a
  variable and will seek a `question` that defines the same
  variable, if such a `question` exists.
