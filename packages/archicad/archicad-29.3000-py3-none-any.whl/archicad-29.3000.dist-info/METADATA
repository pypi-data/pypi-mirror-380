* Archicad 24 beta 3 or later.
* Python 3.7 or later (Tcl/Tk is recommended)

## Getting started

* Install the package with pip
* *Optional: Enable the experimental Python palette in Archicad*
* Run your own scripts either from the command line or directly from ARCHICAD

## Release notes

### 29.3000

Here's an overview of the changes included in this release:
* PropertyTypes
    - A new property called `NormalPropertyValue` has been added.
* Types
    - A new enum value called `All` has been added to `ElementTypes` enum.
* GetElementsRelatedToZones
    - The `elementTypes` command parameter is now required.
        - In cases where `elementTypes` was not used previously, use it with the newly added `All` value.
* GetPropertyValuesOfElements
    - A new parameter called `onlySupportedTypes` has been added.
        - Optional parameter. When it is set to true, only elements with types that are supported by any other JSON API command will be returned.
