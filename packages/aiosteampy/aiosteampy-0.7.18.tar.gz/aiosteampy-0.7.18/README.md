Previously this library was a soft fork of [bukson/steampy](https://github.com/bukson/steampy) with intend to
provide asynchronous methods and proxies support.
But now it _standalone_ project.

> Created for steam trading purposes mostly.
> Inspired by [DoctorMcKay/node-steamcommunity](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steamcommunity)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project is unstable and there might be some breaking changes in the future unless stable (**first major**) version

<!--install-start-->

## Installation

```shell
pip install aiosteampy
```

```shell
pipenv install aiosteampy
```

```shell
poetry add aiosteampy
```

```shell
uv add aiosteampy
```

Project does have extras as [socks](https://aiosteampy.somespecial.one/proxies) proxies
and currencies [converter](https://aiosteampy.somespecial.one/ext/converter/).

Either of extras can be installed separately with the appropriate **installation target**:
`aiosteampy[socks]` or `aiosteampy[converter]`.

Or all extras at once `aiosteampy[all]`.

An **UV** example

```shell
uv add aiosteampy[socks]
```

<!--intro-start-->

AIOSTEAMPY use [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) underneath to do asynchronous requests to steam servers,
with modern async/await syntax.

## Key features âœ¨

- **Stateless**: low-middle layer API wrapper of some steam services and methods like market,
  tradeoffers, confirmations, steamguard, etc.
- **Declarative**: there is models or `TypedDict`s for every data.
- **Typed**: High-end support with extensive typing, tested on `VSCode` and `PyCharm`.
- **Simple**: Fit most important related to steam trading process methods.
- **Web proxy** support.

## What can I do with this

- Operate with steam trade offers.
- Sell, buy items on market. Place, cancel orders.
- Login trough steam to 3rd party sites.
- Fetch data from market.
- Manipulate many accounts with proxies for each session.
- Get and load cookies to stay logged in (session persistence).
- Convert market prices into different currencies.

## What I can't do

- Chat.
- Get apps, packages.
- All, that need connection to CM.
- Interact with game servers (inspect CS2 (ex. CSGO) items, ...).
- Social interaction(groups, clans).
- Handle entities (listings, items, tradeoffers) lifecycle for easy if you need to store it.

## Tests ðŸ§ª

> [!WARNING]
> Test cases and test code as a whole are deprecated and will not work until they are updated (a lot of work).
> I'll leave the code and this heading here as a reminder ðŸ«£
