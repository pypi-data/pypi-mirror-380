"""
This module contains functions for splitting names of single-shot image files
for non-ALC datasets by file type and scan name. Dataset loading using these
functions is implemented in the non-ALC colab_zirc_dims processing Notebook.
This is a separate module to streamline the processing of potentially extending
colab_zirc_dims dataset import capabilities to new LA-ICP-MS facilities.

Users with LA-ICP-MS RL image datasets with currently-unsupported formatting
can write their own filename-splitting function into the non-ALC
processing notebook (consider a pull request to this module if you have done
this!). If more extensive changes/additions to the package seem to be needed,
Python-naive users are encouraged to send a sample dataset (i.e., images and
any associated metadata/scaling files) to the colab_zirc_dims project manager
(contact details on GitHub) for potential package support in the future.

Functions in this module should take a image file name string as an input
and return strings SAMPLE_NAME, SCAN_NAME. The output sample name can be a
generic value if sample names are not found in file names. Output spot names
should but do not have to be unique per-sample. New functions should be added
to the default_name_fxns dict before 'None'.
