TMIN (an abbreviation for "minimum thickness") is an open source python package designed to help engineers determine if corroded process piping in refineries and pertrochemical plants are **safe** and **API-compliant** â€” in seconds.

Many oil and gas companies are faced with maintaining thousands of miles of 100+ year old piping networks supporting multi-million dollar/year processing operations. There is rarely a simple solution to immediately shutdown a process pipe - as these shutdowns more often than not impact other units and cost companies millions in time and resources.

***TMIN can be used as a conservative and rapid engineering support tool for assessing piping inspection data and determine how close the pipe is to its end of service life.***

# How to install and get started

### Installation:

```bash
pip install tmin
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from tmin import PIPE

# Create pipe instance
pipe = PIPE(
    pressure=50,           # Design pressure (psi)
    nps=2,                 # Nominal pipe size (inches)
    schedule=40,           # Pipe schedule
    pressure_class=150,    # Pressure class
    metallurgy="Intermediate/Low CS",
    yield_stress=23333     # Yield stress (psi)
)

# Analyze measured thickness
results = pipe.analyze(
    measured_thickness=0.060,  # Measured thickness (inches)
    year_inspected=2023        # Optional: inspection year
)

print(f"Flag: {results['flag']}")
print(f"Status: {results['status']}")
print(f"Governing thickness: {results['governing_thickness']:.4f} inches")
```

## Docker Usage

Run TMIN in a container:

```bash
# Build and run
./docker.sh build
./docker.sh run

# Or test functionality
./docker.sh test
```
