    This step wraps a component, manages its inputs and outputs, and integrates it into the pipeline.

        component (Component): The component to be executed in this step.
        input_map (dict[str, str | Val] | None): Unified input map.

            input_state_map (dict[str, str]): Mapping of component input arguments to pipeline state keys.
                Keys are input arguments expected by the component, values are corresponding state keys.

                3. dict[str, Val] for fixed args.
                Defaults to None.
            retry_config (RetryConfig | None, optional): Configuration for retry behavior using
                GLLM Core\'s RetryConfig. Defaults to None, in which case no retry config is applied.
            error_handler (BaseStepErrorHandler | None, optional): Strategy to handle errors during execution.
                Defaults to None, in which case the RaiseStepErrorHandler is used.
            cache_store ("BaseCache" | None, optional): Cache store to be used for caching.
                Defaults to None, in which case no cache store is used.
            cache_config (dict[str, Any] | None, optional): Cache configuration to be used for caching.
                Defaults to None, in which case no cache configuration is used.
