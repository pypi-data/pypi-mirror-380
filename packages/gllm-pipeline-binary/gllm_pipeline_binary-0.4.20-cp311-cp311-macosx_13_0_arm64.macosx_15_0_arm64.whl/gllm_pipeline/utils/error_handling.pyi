    '''Standardized error context for pipeline steps.

    This model provides a structured way to represent error context information
    for pipeline steps, ensuring consistency in error messages across the pipeline.

    Attributes:
        exception (BaseException): The exception that was raised.
        step_name (str): The name of the pipeline step where the error occurred.
        step_type (str): The type of pipeline step where the error occurred.
        state (dict[str, Any] | BaseModel | None): The pipeline state at the time of the error.
            Defaults to None.
        operation (str): Description of the operation being performed when the error occurred.
            Defaults to "execution".
        additional_context (str | None): Additional context to include in the error message.
            Defaults to None.
