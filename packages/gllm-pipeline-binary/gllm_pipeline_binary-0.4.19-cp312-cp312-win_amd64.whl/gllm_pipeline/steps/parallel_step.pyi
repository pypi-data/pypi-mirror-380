class ParallelStep(BranchingStep, HasInputsMixin):
    """A pipeline step that executes multiple branches in parallel.

    This step wraps multiple branches and executes them concurrently, then merges their results.
    Each branch can be either a single step or a list of steps to be executed sequentially.

    The step supports two execution modes controlled by the `squash` parameter:
    1. Squashed (default): Uses asyncio.gather() to run branches in parallel within a single LangGraph node. Use for:
       a. Better raw performance
       b. Simpler implementation
       c. Less overhead
       d. Less transparent for debugging and tracing
    2. Expanded (squash=False): Creates a native LangGraph structure with multiple parallel paths. Use for:
       a. More native LangGraph integration
       b. More transparent for debugging and tracing

    For memory optimization, you can specify input_states to pass only specific keys to branches.
    This is especially useful when the state is large but branches only need specific parts of it.
    If input_states is None (default), all state keys will be passed.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for this pipeline step.
        branches (dict[str, PipelineSteps]): The branches to execute in parallel.
        input_map (dict[str, str | Val] | None): Unified input map.
        squash (bool): Whether to squash execution into a single node.
            1. If True, uses asyncio.gather() to run branches in parallel. This will create a single node.
            2. If False, uses native LangGraph structures for parallelism. This will create multiple nodes.
        retry_policy (RetryPolicy | None): Configuration for retry behavior using LangGraph's RetryPolicy.

            branches (list | dict[str, PipelineSteps]): The branches to execute in parallel. Can be either:
                **List format:**
                    Each branch can be:
                    1. A single step
                    2. A list of steps to execute sequentially
                    Example: [step1, [step2, step3], step4]
                **Dict format:**
                    Keys are branch names, values can be:
                    1. A single step
                    2. A list of steps to execute sequentially
                    Example: {"analysis": step1, "validation": [step2, step3], "cleanup": step4}
                    Enables more intuitive step exclusion using branch names.
            input_states (list[str] | None, optional): Keys from the state to pass to branches.
                If None, all state keys will be passed. Defaults to None.

                2. If False, uses native LangGraph structures for parallelism. This will create multiple nodes.

            fixed_args (dict[str, Any] | None, optional): Fixed arguments to be passed to the component.

            input_map (InputMapSpec | None, optional):
                Unified input map. Can be a dict (arg -> str|Val) or a list with elements:
                1. str for identity mapping
                2. dict[str, str] for state/config mapping
                3. dict[str, Val] for fixed args.
                Defaults to None.
            retry_config (RetryConfig | None, optional): Configuration for retry behavior using
                GLLM Core\'s RetryConfig. Defaults to None, in which case no retry config is applied.
            error_handler (BaseStepErrorHandler | None, optional): Strategy to handle errors during execution.
                Defaults to None, in which case the RaiseStepErrorHandler is used.
            cache_store ("BaseCache" | None, optional): Cache store to be used for caching.
