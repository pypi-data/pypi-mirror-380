NeuralCache is a lightweight reranker for RAG pipelines that *actually remembers what helped*. It blends dense semantic similarity with a narrative memory of past wins and stigmergic pheromones that reward helpful passages while decaying stale ones—then spices in MMR diversity and ε-greedy exploration. The result: more relevant context for your LLM without rebuilding your stack.

> This repository open-sources the NeuralCache reranker. The broader “Cognitive Tetrad” engine remains proprietary IP and is not included here.

## ⚡ 60-second quickstart

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install neuralcache

# 2. Launch the API (Ctrl+C to stop)
uvicorn neuralcache.api.server:app --port 8080 --reload

# 3. Hit the reranker
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/rerank \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query":"What is stigmergy?",
    "documents":[
      {"id":"a","text":"Stigmergy is indirect coordination via shared context."},
      {"id":"b","text":"Vector DBs store embeddings for retrieval."}
    ],
    "top_k":2
  }' | python -m json.tool
```

Prefer a single command? 👇

```bash
pip install neuralcache && \
uvicorn neuralcache.api.server:app --port 8080 --reload & \
server_pid=$! && sleep 3 && \
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/rerank -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query":"What is stigmergy?","documents":[{"id":"a","text":"Stigmergy is indirect coordination."},{"id":"b","text":"Vector DBs store embeddings."}],"top_k":2}' | python -m json.tool && \
kill $server_pid
```

### Need batch reranking or Prometheus metrics?

```bash
pip install neuralcache[ops]
uvicorn neuralcache.api.server_plus:app --port 8081 --reload
```

- Batch endpoint: `POST http://127.0.0.1:8081/rerank/batch`
- Metrics scrape: `GET  http://127.0.0.1:8081/metrics` (requires the `prometheus-client` dependency supplied by the `ops` extra)
- Legacy routes remain available under `/v1/...`

---

## Why teams choose NeuralCache

- **Drop-in reranker** for any retriever that can send JSON. Works with Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Chroma—or your own Postgres table.
- **Narrative memory (EMA)** keeps track of passages that consistently helped users, biasing future reranks toward them.
- **Stigmergic pheromones** reward useful documents but decay over time, preventing filter bubbles.
- **MMR + ε-greedy** introduces diversity without tanking relevance.
- **Zero external dependencies by default.** Uses a hashing trick for embeddings so you can see results instantly, but slots in any vector model when you’re ready.
- **Adapters included.** LangChain and LlamaIndex adapters ship in `neuralcache.adapters` and only import their extras when you use them.
- **CLI + REST API + FastAPI docs** give you multiple ways to integrate and debug.
- **Plus API** adds `/rerank/batch` and Prometheus-ready `/metrics` endpoints when you run `uvicorn neuralcache.api.server_plus:app` (install the `neuralcache[ops]` extra for dependencies).
- **SQLite persistence out of the box.** `neuralcache.storage.sqlite_state.SQLiteState` keeps narrative + pheromone state durable across workers without JSON file juggling.
- **Cognitive gating** right-sizes the rerank set on the fly, trimming obvious non-starters to save downstream tokens without losing recall.

### Use cases

- *Customer support copilots* → surface articles with the exact resolution steps.
- *Internal knowledge bases* → highlight documents that past agents actually referenced.
- *Vertical SaaS (legal/health/finance)* → pair compliance-ready snippets with LLM summaries.
- *Evaluation harnesses* → measure and tune Context-Use@K uplift before going live.

## How it works

| Signal | What it captures | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dense similarity** | Cosine distance over embeddings (hash-based fallback out of the box) | Makes sure obviously relevant passages rank high. |
| **Narrative EMA** | Exponential moving average of successful context windows | Remembers story arcs across multi-turn conversations. |
| **Stigmergic pheromones** | Exposure-aware reinforcement with decay | Rewards docs that helped *recently* while fading stale ones. |
| **MMR diversity** | Maximal Marginal Relevance | Reduces redundancy and surfaces complementary evidence. |
| **ε-greedy exploration** | Occasional exploration of long-tail docs | Keeps fresh signals flowing so the model doesn’t get stuck. |

All of this is orchestrated by `neuralcache.rerank.Reranker`, configurable through [`Settings`](src/neuralcache/config.py) or environment variables (`NEURALCACHE_*`).

---

## Cognitive gating

NeuralCache now ships with an entropy-aware gating layer that decides how many candidates to score for each query. The gate looks at the dense similarity distribution, estimates uncertainty with a softmax entropy probe, and then uses a logistic curve to select a candidate budget between your configured min/max bounds.

- **Modes**: `off` (never trims), `auto` (entropy-driven; default), `on` (always apply gating using provided thresholds).
- **Overrides**: Pass a `gating_overrides` dict on `/rerank` or `/rerank/batch` calls to tweak mode, min/max candidates, threshold, or temperature per request.
- **Observability**: Enable `return_debug=true` to receive `gating` telemetry (mode, uncertainty, chosen candidate count, masked ids) alongside the rerank results.

Gating plugs in before narrative, pheromone, and MMR scoring—so downstream memories and pheromones still receive consistent updates even when the candidate pool shrinks.

---

## Integrations & interfaces

- **REST API** (`uvicorn neuralcache.api.server:app`) with `/rerank`, `/feedback`, `/metrics`, and `/healthz` endpoints.
- **Plus API** (`uvicorn neuralcache.api.server_plus:app`) adds `/rerank/batch`, Prometheus `/metrics`, and mounts the legacy routes under `/v1`.
- **CLI** (`neuralcache "<query>" docs.jsonl --top-k 5`) for quick experiments and scripting.
- **LangChain adapter**: `from neuralcache.adapters import NeuralCacheLangChainReranker`
- **LlamaIndex adapter**: `from neuralcache.adapters import NeuralCacheLlamaIndexReranker`

See [`examples/quickstart.py`](examples/quickstart.py) for an end-to-end script.

## Configuration essentials

| Env var | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEURALCACHE_WEIGHT_DENSE` | Weight on dense similarity | `1.0` |
| `NEURALCACHE_WEIGHT_NARRATIVE` | Weight on narrative memory | `0.6` |
| `NEURALCACHE_WEIGHT_PHEROMONE` | Weight on pheromone signal | `0.3` |
| `NEURALCACHE_MAX_DOCUMENTS` | Safety cap on rerank set size | `128` |
| `NEURALCACHE_MAX_TEXT_LENGTH` | Hard limit on document length (characters) | `8192` |
| `NEURALCACHE_STORAGE_DIR` | Where SQLite + JSON state is stored | `storage/` |
| `NEURALCACHE_GATING_MODE` | Cognitive gate mode (`off`, `auto`, `on`) | `auto` |
| `NEURALCACHE_GATING_THRESHOLD` | Uncertainty threshold for trimming | `0.45` |
| `NEURALCACHE_GATING_MIN_CANDIDATES` | Lower bound for rerank candidates | `8` |
| `NEURALCACHE_GATING_MAX_CANDIDATES` | Upper bound for rerank candidates | `48` |
| `NEURALCACHE_GATING_TEMPERATURE` | Softmax temperature when estimating entropy | `1.0` |

Adjust everything via `.env`, environment variables, or direct `Settings(...)` instantiation.

Persistence happens automatically using SQLite (or JSON fallback) so narrative and pheromone stores survive restarts. Point `NEURALCACHE_STORAGE_DIR` at shared storage for multi-worker deployments, or import `SQLiteState` directly if you need to wire the persistence layer into an existing app container.

## Evaluation: prove the uplift

We ship `scripts/eval_context_use.py` to measure Context-Use@K on any JSONL dataset (query, docs, answer). It can compare a baseline retriever with a NeuralCache-powered candidate. Install the `neuralcache[ops]` extra to pull in the `requests` dependency used by the script and Prometheus exporters in one go.

Want to stress-test gating specifically? Run `scripts/eval_gating.py` to generate a synthetic A/B comparison between the entropy-driven gate and a control configuration. The script logs summaries to stdout and writes a CSV artifact you can pull into spreadsheets or dashboards.

```bash
python scripts/eval_context_use.py \
  --api http://localhost:8080 \
  --data data/sample_rag.jsonl \
  --out reports/neuralcache_eval.csv \
  --top-k 5

# Optional: compare against another API host
python scripts/eval_context_use.py \
  --api http://localhost:8000 --data data/sample_rag.jsonl \
  --compare-api http://localhost:8080 --out reports/compare.csv
```

Example output (toy dataset):

```
Eval complete in 4.82s | Baseline Context-Use@5: 9/20 | NeuralCache: 13/20
```

Use the generated CSV to inspect which queries improved, regressions, and latency statistics.

### Sample datasets

The previous synthetic Context-Use demo is being redesigned. We’ll publish a refreshed walkthrough once the new baseline is validated. In the meantime you can point `scripts/eval_context_use.py` at your own JSONL datasets to measure uplift between any two rerankers.

## Metrics & observability

- `/metrics` exposes Prometheus counters for request volume, success rate, and Context-Use@K proxy. Install the `neuralcache[ops]` extra (bundles `prometheus-client`) and run the Plus API for an out-of-the-box scrape target.
- Structured logging (via `rich` + standard logging) shows rerank decisions with scores.
- Extend telemetry by dropping in OpenTelemetry exporters or shipping events to your own observability stack.

---

## Roadmap

- ✅ SQLite persistence (drop-in)
- ✅ Batch `/rerank` endpoint
- ✅ LangChain + LlamaIndex adapters
- ☐ Semantic Context-Use@K metric
- ☐ Prometheus/OpenTelemetry exporters
- ☐ Optional Rust / Numba core for hot loops
