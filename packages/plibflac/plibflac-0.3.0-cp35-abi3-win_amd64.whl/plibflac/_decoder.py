class Decoder:
    """
    Decoder for a FLAC audio stream.

    A Decoder object reads compressed audio data from a FLAC file, and
    outputs the decompressed samples when `read` is called.

    To ensure resources are cleaned up, call `close` when the decoder
    is no longer needed, or use a ``with`` statement.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : path-like object or binary file object
        Either the name of the input file, or an existing file object
        (which must be a readable binary file).
    errors : str, optional
        Error handling mode; may be set to ``'strict'``, ``'warn'``,
        or ``'ignore'``.
    md5_checking : bool, optional
        Whether to verify the stream's MD5 hash if possible.  If
        `md5_checking` is set to True, then `close` will raise an
        exception if the file appears to have been corrupted or
        truncated.  Most applications should leave this set to False
        for better performance.

    Attributes
    ----------
    channels : int
        The number of channels in the input stream (between one and
        eight).
    bits_per_sample : int
        The resolution of each sample in the input stream (between 4
        and 32).
    sample_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the input stream, in samples per
        second.
    total_samples : int
        The length of the input stream, in samples (in other words,
        the total number of samples *per channel*).

    Notes
    -----
    Conceptually, a FLAC file can be thought of as a table of numbers,
    with up to eight columns (representing physical channels, such as
    left and right speakers) and any number of rows (representing
    equally-spaced points in time.)  Each number (sample) is an
    integer between ``-2**(bits_per_sample-1)`` and
    ``2**(bits_per_sample-1)-1``.

    Internally, the decoder maintains an input position corresponding
    to a sample number (or row in the table), starting at the
    beginning (sample number zero.)  When you call the `read` method,
    the specified number of samples (rows) are decoded and returned,
    and the input position is advanced.  To move the input position to
    a particular sample number, call the `seek` method.

    The `channels`, `bits_per_sample`, `sample_rate`, and
    `total_samples` attributes will all be zero until you call `seek`,
    `read`, or `read_metadata` for the first time.
