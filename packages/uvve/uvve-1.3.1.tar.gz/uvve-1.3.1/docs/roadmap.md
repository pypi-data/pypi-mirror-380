# uvve Roadmap

This document outlines the planned evolution of `uvve` from MVP to a production-grade Python environment management tool.

## üå± Development Philosophy

uvve follows a phased development approach, starting with a fast-to-market MVP and evolving toward a comprehensive environment management solution.

### Strategic Approach

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Build in Python for rapid iteration and community contribution  
**Phase 2 (Future)**: Consider Rust rewrite once features stabilize for performance and distribution benefits

This mirrors successful tool evolution patterns (Poetry ‚Üí Rye, Pip ‚Üí uv).

## üìã Phase 1: MVP ‚úÖ (Complete)

### Core Features ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Environment Management**: `uvve create`, `list`, `activate`, `remove`
- ‚úÖ **Python Integration**: Wrap `uv python` + `uv venv`
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Storage**: Store environments in `~/.uvve`
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform Support**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Rich CLI**: Beautiful output with Typer and Rich

### Lockfile System ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Freeze & Thaw**: `uvve lock` and `uvve thaw` commands
- ‚úÖ **TOML Format**: Structured, human-readable lockfiles
- ‚úÖ **Metadata Tracking**: Python version, timestamp, platform info
- ‚úÖ **Reproducibility**: Deterministic environment recreation

### Shell Integration ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Multi-shell Support**: bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell

## üåü Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (Planned)

**Goal**: Seamless integration with Python development ecosystem

### Distribution & Installation

- [ ] **Homebrew Formula**: Easy installation on macOS/Linux
  ```bash
  brew install uvve
  ```
- [ ] **Package Managers**: apt, yum, chocolatey support
- [ ] **Self-updating**: Built-in update mechanism

### Project Integration

- [ ] **Global Hooks**: `.uvve-version` files in project directories
  ```bash
  cd myproject/
  cat .uvve-version  # myproject-env
  uvve activate      # auto-detects environment
  ```
- [ ] **Project Linking**: Connect projects to environments
  ```bash
  uvve link myproject-env    # link current dir to environment
  uvve unlink               # remove link
  uvve status               # show current project/env status
  ```

### Workspace Features

- [ ] **Workspace Isolation**: Optional `.venv` symlinks
  ```bash
  uvve workspace enable     # create .venv -> ~/.uvve/name
  uvve workspace disable    # remove symlink
  ```
- [ ] **IDE Integration**: VS Code, PyCharm extensions
- [ ] **Git Integration**: Hooks for environment consistency

### Advanced Lockfile Features

- [ ] **Multi-platform Lockfiles**: Support different OS requirements
- [ ] **Dependency Groups**: Development, testing, production groups
- [ ] **Lock Strategies**: Conservative vs aggressive updates
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection in lockfiles

## üîó Phase 4: uv Ecosystem Integration (Future)

**Goal**: Deep integration with the uv project ecosystem

### Project Workflow Integration

- [ ] **uv.lock Linking**: Connect project dependencies with managed environments
  ```bash
  uv project init               # project metadata
  uvve link myproj            # link current env to project
  uvve sync-project           # sync env with uv.lock
  ```

### Complementary Responsibilities

- **uv Focus**: Project-focused (dependencies, builds, publishing)
- **uvve Focus**: Environment-focused (versions, shims, isolation)

### Future Collaboration

- [ ] **Shared Configuration**: Common config formats where applicable
- [ ] **Tool Integration**: `uv` commands aware of `uvve` environments
- [ ] **Unified Workflows**: Seamless developer experience

## ü¶Ä Phase 5: Rust Evolution (Future Consideration)

**Goal**: Performance and distribution optimization
