class BFSSolver:

    A solver that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore possible move sequences 
    and determine whether a puzzle configuration can be solved.

    This class delegates puzzle-specific logic (gravity, move execution, match detection) 
    to external components provided via `grid_initializer` and `puzzle_logic`.

        Attempt to solve the puzzle using Breadth-First Search (BFS) within a limited number of moves.

        in `min_nb_moves` steps or fewer.

        It starts from the initial grid state and simulates possible actions at each round. Each node
