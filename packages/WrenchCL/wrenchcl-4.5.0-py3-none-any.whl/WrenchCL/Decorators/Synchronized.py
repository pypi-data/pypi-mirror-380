def Synchronized(lock: threading.Lock) -> Callable[[Callable[..., Any]], Callable[..., Any]]:
    """
    Decorator to ensure that a method is executed with a lock, preventing concurrent access from multiple threads.

    This decorator is useful in scenarios where thread safety is a concern, particularly when accessing shared resources
    such as database connections, files, or any other critical section of the code that should not be concurrently accessed.

    The `synchronized` decorator can be applied to any method that requires thread-safe execution. It uses a threading
    lock to ensure that only one thread can execute the decorated method at any given time.

    :param lock: A threading.Lock object used to lock the method. If no lock is provided, a ValueError is raised.
    :type lock: threading.Lock
    :raises ValueError: If the lock is not provided or is None.
    :returns: A decorator that wraps the target method with lock acquisition and release.
    :rtype: Callable[[Callable[..., Any]], Callable[..., Any]]

    **Example Usage**::

        >>> import threading
        >>> from mypackage.decorators import synchronized
        >>>
        >>> class SharedResource:
        >>>     _lock = threading.Lock()
        >>>
        >>>     @synchronized(_lock)
        >>>     def critical_section(self, value):
        >>>         # critical section that should not be accessed concurrently
        >>>         print(f"Processing value: {value}")
        >>>
        >>> resource = SharedResource()
        >>>
        >>> # Simulating concurrent access to the critical section
        >>> t1 = threading.Thread(target=resource.critical_section, args=(1,))
        >>> t2 = threading.Thread(target=resource.critical_section, args=(2,))
        >>> t1.start()
        >>> t2.start()
        >>> t1.join()
        >>> t2.join()

        raise ValueError("A threading.Lock object must be provided to the synchronized decorator.")
