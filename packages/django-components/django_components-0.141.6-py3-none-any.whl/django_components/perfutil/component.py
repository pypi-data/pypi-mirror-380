# via `outer_context`. This make is possible to access the correct data
# inside `{% fill %}` tags.
#
# Previously, `ComponentContext` was stored directly on the `Context` object, but
# this was problematic:
# - The need for creating a Context snapshot meant potentially a lot of copying
# - It was hard to trace and debug. Because if you printed the Context, it included the
#   `ComponentContext` data, including the `outer_context` which contained another
#   `ComponentContext` object, and so on.

# Thus, similarly to the data stored by `{% provide %}`, we store the actual

# When a component is rendered, we want to apply HTML attributes like `data-djc-id-ca1b3cf`
# to all root elements. However, we have to approach it smartly, to minimize the HTML parsing.
#
# If we naively first rendered the child components, and then the parent component, then we would
# have to parse the child's HTML twice (once for itself, and once as part of the parent).
# When we have a deeply nested component structure, this can add up to a lot of parsing.
# See https://github.com/django-components/django-components/issues/14#issuecomment-2596096632.
#
# Imagine we first render the child components. Once rendered, child's HTML gets embedded into
# the HTML of the parent. So by the time we get to the root, we will have to parse the full HTML
# document, even if the root component is only a small part of the document.
#
# So instead, when a nested component is rendered, we put there only a placeholder, and store the
# actual HTML content in `component_renderer_cache`.
#
# ```django
# <div>
#   <h2>...</h2>
#   <template djc-render-id="a1b3cf"></template>
#   <span>...</span>
#   <template djc-render-id="f3d3cf"></template>
# </div>
# ```
#
# The full flow is as follows:
# 1. When a component is nested in another, the child component is rendered, but it returns
#    only a placeholder like `<template djc-render-id="a1b3cf"></template>`.
#    The actual HTML output is stored in `component_renderer_cache`.
# 2. The parent of the child component is rendered normally.
# 3. If the placeholder for the child component is at root of the parent component,
#    then the placeholder may be tagged with extra attributes, e.g. `data-djc-id-ca1b3cf`.
#    `<template djc-render-id="a1b3cf" data-djc-id-ca1b3cf></template>`.
# 4. When the parent is done rendering, we go back to step 1., the parent component
#    either returns the actual HTML, or a placeholder.
# 5. Only once we get to the root component, that has no further parents, is when we finally
#    start putting it all together.
# 6. We start at the root component. We search the root component's output HTML for placeholders.
#    Each placeholder has ID `data-djc-render-id` that links to its actual content.
# 7. For each found placeholder, we replace it with the actual content.
#    But as part of step 7), we also:
#    - If any of the child placeholders had extra attributes, we cache these, so we can access them
#      once we get to rendering the child component.
#    - And if the parent component had any extra attributes set by its parent, we apply these
#      to the root elements.
# 8. Lastly, we merge all the parts together, and return the final HTML.

    # Case: Nested component
    # If component is nested, return a placeholder

    # ```
    # ComponentA
    #   ComponentB
    #     ComponentC
    # ```
    #
    # And these components are embedded one in another using the `{% component %}` tag.

    # <!-- ComponentA -->
    # <div>
    #   {% component "ComponentB" / %}
    # </div>
    # ```
    #
    # Then the order in which components call `component_post_render()` is:
    # 1. ComponentB - Triggered by `{% component "ComponentB" / %}` while A's template is being rendered,
    #                 returns only a placeholder.
    # 2. ComponentA - Triggered by the end of A's template. A isn't nested, so it starts full component
    #                 tree render. This replaces B's placeholder with actual HTML and introduces C's placeholder.
    #                 And so on...
    # 3. ComponentC - Triggered by `{% component "ComponentC" / %}` while B's template is being rendered
    #                 as part of full component tree render. Returns only a placeholder, to be replaced in next
    #                 step.

        return mark_safe(f'<template djc-render-id="{render_id}"></template>')

    # Case: Root component - Construct the final HTML by recursively replacing placeholders
    #
    # We first generate the component's HTML content, by calling the renderer.
    #
    # Then we process the component's HTML from root-downwards, going depth-first.
    # So if we have a template:
    # ```django
    # <div>
    #   <h2>...</h2>
    #   {% component "ComponentB" / %}
    #   <span>...</span>
    #   {% component "ComponentD" / %}
    # </div>
    # ```
    #
    # Then component's template is rendered, replacing nested components with placeholders:
    # ```html
    # <div>
    #   <h2>...</h2>
    #   <template djc-render-id="a1b3cf"></template>
    #   <span>...</span>
    #   <template djc-render-id="f3d3cf"></template>
    # </div>
    # ```
    #
    # Then we first split up the current HTML into parts, splitting at placeholders:
    # - <div><h2>...</h2>
    # - PLACEHOLDER djc-render-id="a1b3cf"
    # - <span>...</span>
    # - PLACEHOLDER djc-render-id="f3d3cf"
    # - </div>
    #
    # And put the pairs of (content, placeholder_id) into a queue:
    # - ("<div><h2>...</h2>", "a1b3cf")
    # - ("<span>...</span>", "f3d3cf")
    # - ("</div>", None)
    #
    # Then we process each part:
    # 1. Append the content to the output
    # 2. If the placeholder ID is not None, then we fetch the renderer by its placeholder ID (e.g. "a1b3cf")
    # 3. If there were any extra attributes set by the parent component, we apply these to the renderer.
    # 4. We split the content by placeholders, and put the pairs of (content, placeholder_id) into the queue,
    #    repeating this whole process until we've processed all nested components.
    # 5. If the placeholder ID is None, then we've reached the end of the component's HTML content,
    #    and we can go one level up to continue the process with component's parent.

    #   {% component "table" / %}
