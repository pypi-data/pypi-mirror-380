This document contains a table of transactions. Each row of the transaction table is a buy (purchase) or a sell (sale) of product.
When the volume column of a row is negative, it indicates a sell. When the volumn column of a row is positive, it indicates a buy.

The volumn column should always be as-is. Make sure the amount column for a row appropriately reflects that a purchase is a negative
value and a sale is a positive value.
