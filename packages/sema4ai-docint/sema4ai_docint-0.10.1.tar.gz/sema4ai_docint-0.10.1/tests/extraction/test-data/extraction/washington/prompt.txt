In this file, there are two sets of tables: first a set of purchases and then a set of sales. They are identified by a header "Sales to.." and then "Purchases from.." respectively. These
tables may span multiple pages of the document. Be sure that you thoroughly read the entire tables.

Make sure to thoroughly look above each row being processed to determine if the row is in the sales or purchases table.
