PyGIP is a Python library designed for experimenting with graph-based model extraction attacks and defenses. It provides
a modular framework to implement and test attack and defense strategies on graph datasets.

## Installation

PyGIP supports both CPU and GPU environments. Make sure you have Python installed (version >= 3.8, <3.13).

### Base Installation

First, install the core package:

```bash
pip install PyGIP
```

This will install PyGIP with minimal dependencies.

### CPU Version

```bash
pip install "PyGIP[torch,dgl]" \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
  -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/repo.html
```

### GPU Version (CUDA 12.1)

```bash
pip install "PyGIP[torch,dgl]" \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 \
  --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
  -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/torch-2.3/cu121/repo.html
```

## Quick Start

Hereâ€™s a simple example to launch a Model Extraction Attack using PyGIP:

```python
from datasets import Cora
from models.attack import ModelExtractionAttack0

# Load the Cora dataset
dataset = Cora()

# Initialize the attack with a sampling ratio of 0.25
mea = ModelExtractionAttack0(dataset, 0.25)

# Execute the attack
mea.attack()
```

This code loads the Cora dataset, initializes a basic model extraction attack (`ModelExtractionAttack0`), and runs the
attack with a specified sampling ratio.

And a simple example to run a Defense method against Model Extraction Attack:

```python
from datasets import Cora
from models.defense import RandomWM

# Load the Cora dataset
dataset = Cora()

# Initialize the attack with a sampling ratio of 0.25
med = RandomWM(dataset, 0.25)

# Execute the defense
med.defend()
```

which runs the Random Watermarking Graph to defend against MEA.

If you want to use cuda, please set environment variable:

```shell
export PYGIP_DEVICE=cuda:0
```
