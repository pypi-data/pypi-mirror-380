This OpenRAIL-M License, as modified, is generally applicable to any machine-learning Model.
The “Open” nomenclature indicates that the licensed Model is be freely accessible to downstream and other users.  The “RAIL” nomenclature indicates that there are use restrictions prohibiting the use of the Model. These restrictions are intended to avoid potential misuse. This License specifies that the  use restrictions in the original License must apply to such derivatives.
NOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows:
1. Definitions 
(a) “Complementary Material” means the applicable source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any.

(e) “Derivatives of the Model” means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for training the other model.
(f) “Distribution” means any transmission, reproduction, publication, distribution, or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means, including but not limited to API-based or web access.
