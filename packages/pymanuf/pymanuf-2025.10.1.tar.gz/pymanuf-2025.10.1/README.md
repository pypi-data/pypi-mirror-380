A very simple Python library to get the manufacturer of a specific MAC address

## Getting Started

### Installation

If you want to use this library for one of your projects, you can install it like any other Python library

```bash
python -m pip install pymanuf
```

### Versioning

The versioning of the library is the following: `YYYY.MM.DD` where the leading `0` is **removed**.

Versions are automatically released every month on the first day of that month.

### Example Usage

#### Offline Lookup (preferred)

```python
from pymanuf import lookup

try:
    manuf = lookup("C4:A8:1D:73:D7:8C")
    print(f"Manufacturer: {manuf}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

#### Online Lookup

```python
from pymanuf.online import lookup

try:
    manuf = lookup("C4:A8:1D:73:D7:8C")
    print(f"Manufacturer: {manuf}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
