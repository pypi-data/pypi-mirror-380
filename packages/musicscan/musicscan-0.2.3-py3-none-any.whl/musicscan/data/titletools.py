class ShortTitle():
    '''
    A short string based on the first letter
    of the first three words of the title of the
    track, and a numerical index.  The value is
    used as a unique indentity value for
    mapping between the song and
    the physical media index.

    Ex: The song "Rock Me Amadeus" would
    have an index value of "rma01".

    The song "99 Luftballons" would
    have an index value of "n9l01"
    because the index value cannot start
    with a number.

    The song "2112" would have an identity
    string value of "n2-01" because the
    code adds a dash between title portion
    and the incrementor.

    The song "A Little Respect" would
    have an index value of "lr01" because
    the code skips the first word if it's
    an article, like 'A', 'An', or 'The'.

    If the there are two songs that have
    similar titles the incrementor value is
    automatically increased to guarauntee
    a unique value.
