# SpecSync

> Selective Markdown sync between your repo and any workspace folder.

SpecSync is a lightweight Python CLI that bridges your repo's ignored `specs/` folder and an external workspace (e.g. an Obsidian vault, a Hugo content directory, or any notes folder).
It lets you **pull only the Markdown files you choose** (via frontmatter), keep them in sync in both directions, and work seamlessly with AI coding tools — so your specs stay organized without cluttering your codebase.

---

## Features
- **Frontmatter filtering** – pull only notes with `expose: true` (and matching `project:` if set).
- **Two-way sync** – pull specs from workspace → repo or push changes back from repo → workspace.
- **Safe by default** – interactive prompts for conflicts, `--force` to skip prompts.
- **Flexible** – works with any folder structure, not tied to Obsidian.
- **Git-like workflow** – familiar `pull` and `push` commands.

## Quick Start

Install with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
pipx install specsync
# or
uv tool install specsync
```

Set your workspace location using environment variables or [direnv](https://direnv.net/):

```bash
# Option 1: Direct export (temporary, current session only)
export SPECSYNC_WORKSPACE_ROOT="~/Documents/Obsidian"

# Option 2: Using direnv (recommended for project-specific config)
# Copy the example file and customize:
cp .envrc.example .envrc
# Edit .envrc with your workspace path, then:
direnv allow
```

Initialize in a repo (creates `specs/` folder and updates `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
specsync init
```

Pull specs from your workspace into the repo's `specs/` folder:

```bash
specsync pull
```

Push changes from the repo back to your workspace:

```bash
specsync push
```

Show current configuration:

```bash
specsync info
```

## Configuration

SpecSync looks for configuration in this order:
1. Command-line flags
2. Environment variables (e.g., `SPECSYNC_WORKSPACE_ROOT`)
3. `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.specsync]`

### Using direnv for Local Configuration

For project-specific environment variables, create a `.envrc` file in your repo root:

```bash
# .envrc
export SPECSYNC_WORKSPACE_ROOT="/Users/you/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/YourVault"
export SPECSYNC_REPO_SPECS_DIR="specs"
export SPECSYNC_PROJECT_NAME="my-project"
```

Then activate it:
```bash
direnv allow
```

Add `.envrc` to your `.gitignore` to keep local paths private:
```bash
echo ".envrc" >> .gitignore
```

### Project Configuration

Example `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[tool.specsync]
workspace_subdir = "specs"    # Subdirectory in workspace
repo_specs_dir = "specs"      # Directory in repo (git-ignored)
project_name = "my-project"   # Optional, auto-detected if not set

[tool.specsync.filter]
require_expose = true         # Only sync files with expose: true
match_project = true          # Only sync files matching project name
```

## Example Frontmatter

Mark specs for syncing with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
expose: true                  # Required for syncing
project: my-project          # Optional, must match if match_project is true
title: GPU Crash Fix
status: draft
---

# GPU Crash Investigation
...
```

Only notes with `expose: true` (and matching `project` when configured) are synced.
