Philippine statutory law:

1. pattern matching
2. unit retrieval
3. database creation
4. template creation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When modifying a database structure, consider four inter-related parts:
>
> 1. The pythonic object, e.g. `NamedTuple`
> 2. The representation of such in the prospective database
> 3. The documentation of the pythonic object found in `/docs`
> 4. The use of all of the above in downstream [decision-utils](https://github.com/justmars/decision-utils).
