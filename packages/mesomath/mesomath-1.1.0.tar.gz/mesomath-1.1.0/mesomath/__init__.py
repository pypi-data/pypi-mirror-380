"""This package is intended for the arithmetic of natural sexagesimal numbers, 
mainly in their "floating" aspect (i.e., by removing all possible trailing 
sexagesimal zeros from the right), as performed by the Babylonian scribes and 
their apprentices in ancient times.

Inpired by the arithmetic part of Baptiste Mélès' MesoCalc, it aims to bring 
this type of calculation to Python programming and to the command line as a 
calculator."""
