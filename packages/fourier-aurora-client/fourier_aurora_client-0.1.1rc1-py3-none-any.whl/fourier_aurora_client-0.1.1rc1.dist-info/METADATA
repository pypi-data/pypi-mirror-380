# Aurora Python Client

This is the Python client for the Aurora API. It allows you to interact with the Aurora API to retrieve data and perform actions on the Aurora platform.

## Entering docker container

To enter the docker container, run the following command:

```
sudo bash docker_run.bash
```

This will start the docker container and drop you into a bash shell inside the container.

Please make sure to have Docker installed and `192.168.3.32:9595/aurora/aurora:feature_tele_1.2` image on your machine.

## Starting Aurora

To start Aurora, run the following command:

```
AuroraCore
```

This will start the Aurora core server.

## Using the client

Start another terminal and use `docker exec` to enter the docker container you just started. Then, run the following command under `src` directory:

```
python3 -m examples.client_usage
```
Then you can follow the instructions in the terminal to interact with the Aurora API.
