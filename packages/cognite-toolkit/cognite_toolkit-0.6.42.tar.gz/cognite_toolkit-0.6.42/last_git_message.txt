[CDF-25835] ðŸ—„ Update Upload command (#2018)

# Description

Toolkit has a `StorageIO` interface for uploading and downloading data.
This interface currently has two upload methods, `upload_items` and
`upload_items_force`. This PR replaces the use of `upload_items` int the
`Upload` command as well as implementing this for `AssetIO` and `RawIO`.
This is the first of two steps to remove `upload_items` such that there
will be only one upload method.

The difference between `upload_items` and `upload_items_force` is that
the force version uses the `HTTPClient` that is more robust against
failing items and gives responses for each item.
