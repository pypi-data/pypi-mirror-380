class Scenario:
    """
    Represents a modelling scenario within an AequilibraE project.

    Each scenario operates independently with its own database and file
    structure while sharing the overall project configuration.

    Scenarios are typically managed through the Project class rather than
    instantiated directly by users.

    The root scenario is special-cased and represents the original project
    configuration. All other scenarios are stored in subdirectories and
    reference their own database files.
