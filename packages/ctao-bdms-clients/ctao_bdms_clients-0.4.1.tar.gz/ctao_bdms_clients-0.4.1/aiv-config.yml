  # configures the kind cluster to use registry mirrors. The mirrors need to be started before the cluster is created and can persist across cluster restarts, this can be done with `make registry-mirror`.

  # enables ingress controller in kind cluster. note that it is not possible to start several clusters with ingress controller enabled at the same time since they will conflict on the same ports. Ingress controller can be deployed in the cluster with `make ingress-controller`.

  # enables the repository mount from host to the kind cluster. This is useful for local development. The workloads in the cluster will be able to mount the host repository by using the host path.
