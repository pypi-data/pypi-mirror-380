This module is a glue module between ``sale_brand`` and
``partner_brand``.

If the customer has a brand assigned, it will set that brand on the
Sales Order. If the customer has no brand, or if the customer is cleared
from the SO, the brand on the SO will also be cleared.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module was developed because it is a common use case for
(sub)contractors and other types of businesses to sell products under
different brands.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

1. Place the ``sale_brand`` module in your Odoo addons path.
2. Install the ``partner_brand`` module in Odoo.

It will auto install if all the dependencies are available.

Configuration
=============

1. Configure Brands on Partners: Navigate to Contacts. Open the customer
   records for which you want to assign a brand.

2. On the customer form, locate the "Brand" field (provided by
   partner_brand) and select the appropriate brand.

3. Save the changes.

Usage
=====

Automatic Brand Setting
-----------------------

When you are on a Stock Picking form:

Selecting a Customer with a Brand:

If you select a customer in the "Customer" (partner_id) field, and that
customer has a brand assigned to them (via the brand_id field on their
contact record), the "Brand" field on the Stock picking will
automatically be populated with the customer's brand.

Selecting a Customer without a Brand:

If you select a customer who does not have a brand assigned to them, the
"Brand" field on the Stock Picking will be automatically cleared (set to
empty/None).

*Changing Customer*:

If you change the customer on an existing picking, the brand on the
picking will update according to the newly selected customer's brand (or
be cleared if the new customer has no brand).

Clearing Customer:

If you clear the "Customer" field on the stock picking (remove the
selected customer), the "Brand" field on the stock picking will also be
automatically cleared.

This behavior is triggered by an onchange mechanism on the partner_id
field of the stock.picking model.

*Manual Override* The automatic setting of the brand based on the
customer is a default behavior. After the brand is automatically
populated (or cleared), you can still manually change or set the brand
on the Stock Picking directly if needed. The onchange mechanism only
triggers when the partner_id field itself is modified.
