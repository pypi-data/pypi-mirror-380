upgrade:
  - |
    Authentication settings for Neutron should be added
    directly to the [neutron] section of the configuration now. The exact
    settings depend on the `auth_type` used. Refer to
    https://docs.openstack.org/keystoneauth/latest/plugin-options.html
    for a list of possible options.
deprecations:
  - |
    As part of the effort to replace the deprecated
    `python-neutronclient` package in Octavia the following options in the
    [neutron] section of the Octavia configuration
    file have been marked as deprecated for removal:
    `endpoint` is replaced by the `endpoint_override` option,
    `endpoint_type` is replaced by the `valid_interfaces` option,
    and `ca_certificates_file` is replaced by the `cafile` option.
    In a future release `ovn-octavia-provider` will no
    longer take the authentication
    settings from the [service_auth] section as a fallback. It will
    require them to be in the [neutron] section.
other:
  - |
    Replaced code that uses the deprecated `python-neutronclient` library with
    code that uses `openstacksdk` and removed `python-neutronclient` as a
    dependency.
