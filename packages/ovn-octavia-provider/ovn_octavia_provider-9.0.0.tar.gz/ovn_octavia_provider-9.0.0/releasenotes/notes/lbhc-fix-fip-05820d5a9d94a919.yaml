    Load Balancer Health Check for Floating IPs are not populated with the
    protocol port. At this way, when a backend is detected on ERROR state
    requests to the Floating IP are still distribute to the ERROR'ed members.
    In order to fix the existing Load Balancer Health Checks it is required to
    recreate the entire Octavia Health Monitor, which will recreate the
    associated OVN Load Balancer Health Check(s).
