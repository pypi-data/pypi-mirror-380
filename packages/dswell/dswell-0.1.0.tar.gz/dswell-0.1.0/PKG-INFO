A daemon-based file deletion utility that allows you to schedule files or directories for deletion after a specified time period.

Why did I create this?

- I often end up writing temporary scripts and then forgetting to delete them, so they clutter my workspace.

What does it do?

- It automatically removes files after a specified ageâ€”you just pass the duration in hours, minutes, and seconds (for example, 1h30m3s), and it deletes the file after the specified time period.


```bash
dswell
