    """Coalesces breakpoints for any failing assert to a single line.

    Coalesces all potential lines where the code may fail into one
    single line that can be marked as a breakpoint.

    Args:
        test (bool): The boolean statement to test, i.e., must evaluate to ``true`` or ``false``.
        msg (str): The message to display if the test is false.

    Note:
        This is necessary because ``pdb`` sometimes does not work well when
        running ``simpy`` due to the way that ``simpy`` handles exceptions.

        This is also helpful when debugging complex behaviors that run the same
        code multiple times.  Instead of manually writing a ``try/except``
        statement, you can use ``debug_assert`` to do that for you, and ignore
        all of them from a single control point.


    Example:
        >>> # 1. Add a ``debug_assert`` statement in your code, e.g.:
        >>> from upstage.utils import debug_assert
        >>> ...
        >>> bar, foo = 0, 1  # <<< change foo to be less than bar to raise
        >>> debug_assert(foo > bar, "foo is not greater than bar")
        >>> # 2. Put a break point on the ``raise error`` line to see why the assert failed.
