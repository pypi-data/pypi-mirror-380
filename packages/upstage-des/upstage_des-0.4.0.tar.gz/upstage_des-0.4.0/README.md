## What is UPSTAGE for?

__UPSTAGE__ is a Python framework for creating robust, behavior-driven Discrete Event Simulations (DES). The primary goal of UPSTAGE is to enable the quick creation of simulations at any desired level of abstraction with built-in data recording, simulation integrity and runtime checks, and assistance for the usual pitfalls in custom discrete-event simulation: interrupts and cancellations. It is designed is to simplify the development process for simulation models of *complex systems of systems*.

__UPSTAGE__ leverages the extensible [__`SimPy`__][simpy-docs] library and adds two concepts to accelerate the generation of complex discrete-event simulations.

1. `Actor` - i.e., an entity that has `State`
2. `Task` - i.e., actions actors can perform and that can be organized into a `TaskNetwork`.

Actors can have multiple networks running on them, their states can be shared, and there are features for interactions between task networks running on the same actor. Those tasks modify the states on their actor, with features for real-time states that update on request without requiring time-stepping or modifying the existing events.

Additional features include:

1. Context-aware `EnvironmentContext`, accessed via `UpstageBase`, enabling thread-safe simulation globals for the _Stage_ and _Named Entities_ (see below).
1. __Active States__ (e.g.,`LinearChangingState`) represent continuous-time attributes of actors that can be queried at discrete points in time, or trigger events when they reach a certain level.
1. Spatial-aware data types (e.g., `CartesianLocation`) and states like the waypoint-following `GeodeticLocationChangingState`.
1. Geodetic and cartesian positions, distances, and motion - with ranged sensing.
1. `NamedEntity` in a thread-safe global context, enabling easier "director" logic creation with less argument passing in your code
1. The `Stage`: a global context variable for simulation properties and attributes. This enables under-the-hood coordination of motion, geography, and other features.
1. __Rehearsal__: Write planning and simulation code in one place only, and "rehearse" an actor through a task network using planning factors to discover task feasibility before the actor attempts to complete the task.
1. All States are recordable, and some record dataclass and dictionary values
1. A `Routine` class for building reusable event behaviors to simplify `Task` coding.
1. Point-To-Point and Routing Table communications handlers.
1. Numerous runtime checks and error handling for typical DES pitfalls: based on more than a decade of custom DES-building experience.
1. And more!
