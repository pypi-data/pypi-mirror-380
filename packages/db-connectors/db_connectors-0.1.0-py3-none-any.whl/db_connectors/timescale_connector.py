class TimescaleConnector(Connector):
    """
    A connector for TimescaleDB that extends the base Connector class.
    It provides methods to connect, disconnect, check connection status, and retrieve connection information.

    Attributes:
        address (str): The TimescaleDB server address.
        port (int): The port number for the TimescaleDB server.
        target (str): The TimescaleDB database name.
        username (str, optional): The username for authentication.
        password (str, optional): The password for authentication.

    Methods:
        connect(): Connects to the TimescaleDB server.
        disconnect(): Disconnects from the TimescaleDB server.
        is_connected(): Checks if the connection to the TimescaleDB server is active.
        get_connection_info(): Returns a dictionary with connection information.
        insert_data(table_name, data): Inserts data into a TimescaleDB table.
