Development
***********

This page describes the development of :mod:`sdmx`.
Contributions are welcome!

- For current development priorities, see the list of `GitHub milestones <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/milestones>`_ and issues/PRs targeted to each.
- For wishlist features, see issues on GitHub tagged `‘enh’ <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/labels/enh>`_ or `‘wishlist’ <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/labels/wishlist>`_.

.. _code-style:

Code style
==========

- This project uses, via `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_:

  - `ruff <https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/>`_ for code style and linting, including:

     - ensure `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_ compliance, and
     - ensure a consistent order for imports (superseding `flake8 <https://flake8.pycqa.org>`_ and `isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`_).
  - `mypy <https://mypy.readthedocs.io>`_ for static type checking.

  These **must** be applied to new or modified code.
  This can be done manually, or through code editor plug-ins.
  `Pre-commit hooks for git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks>`_ can be installed via:

  .. code-block:: shell

     pip install pre-commit
     pre-commit install

  These will ensure that each commit is compliant with the code style.

- The `pytest.yaml GitHub Actions workflow <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/actions/workflows/pytest.yaml>`_ checks code quality for pull requests and commits.
  This check **must** pass for pull requests to be merged.
- Follow `the 7 rules of a great Git commit message <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules>`_.
- Write docstrings in the `numpydoc <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ style.

Testing
=======

Specimens and data
------------------

.. versionadded:: 2.0

A variety of *specimens*—example files from real web services, or published with the standards—are used to test that :mod:`sdmx` correctly reads and writes the different SDMX message formats.

Specimens are stored in the separate `sdmx-test-data <https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx-test-data>`__ repository.

Running the test suite requires these files.
The simplest way to do this is to give the :program:`--sdmx-fetch-data` option when invoking :program:`pytest`::

  $ pytest --sdmx-fetch-data

This invokes :meth:`SpecimenCollection.fetch`, which uses :program:`git` (via `GitPython <https://gitpython.readthedocs.io>`_) to retrieve and unpack the files to a directory like :file:`$HOME/.cache/sdmx/test-data/`.
:ref:`See below <sdmx-test-data>` for more advanced options.

Contents and layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Specimen files** are:

- Arranged in directories with names matching particular sources in :file:`sources.json`.
- Named with:

  - Certain keywords:

    - ``-structure``: a structure message, often associated with a file with a similar name containing a data message.
    - ``ts``: time-series data, i.e. with a TimeDimensions at the level of individual Observations.
    - ``xs``: cross-sectional data arranged in other ways.
    - ``flat``: flat DataSets with all Dimensions at the Observation level.
    - ``ss``: structure-specific data messages.

  - In some cases, the query string or data flow/structure ID as the file name.
  - Hyphens ``-`` instead of underscores ``_``.

.. _recorded-responses:

The :file:`recorded/` directory contains **recorded HTTP responses** from certain SDMX-REST web services.
These files are stored using the :mod:`requests_cache` :doc:`file system backend <requests-cache:user_guide/backends/filesystem>`; see those docs for the name and format of the files.

.. _sdmx-test-data:

Custom test data directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to place the test data in a specific directory; for instance, in order to commit new files to the specimen collection.
Use one of the following methods:

1. Obtain the files by one of two methods:

   a. Clone ``sdmx-test-data``::

       $ git clone git@github.com:khaeru/sdmx-test-data.git

   b. Download https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx-test-data/archive/main.zip

2. Indicate where :program:`pytest` can find the files, by one of two methods:

   a. Set the ``SDMX_TEST_DATA`` environment variable::

       # Set the variable only for one command
       $ SDMX_TEST_DATA=/path/to/files pytest

       # Export the variable to the environment
       $ export SDMX_TEST_DATA
       $ pytest

   b. Give the option ``--sdmx-test-data=<PATH>`` when invoking :program:`pytest`::

       $ pytest --sdmx-test-data=/path/to/files

.. _test-network:

Network vs. offline tests
-------------------------

Tests related to particular SDMX-REST web services can be categorized as:

- Ensuring :mod:`sdmx` can interact with the service *as-is*.

  These include the :ref:`full matrix of source-endpoint tests <source-policy>`, which run on a nightly schedule because they are slow.
  They also include other tests (for instance, of code snippets appearing in this documentation) marked with the custom pytest mark :py:`@pytest.mark.network` that make actual network requests.
  These tests may appear ‘flaky’: they are vulnerable to network interruptions, or temporary downtime/incapacity of the targeted service(s).

- Ensuring :mod:`sdmx` can handle certain SDMX messages or HTTP responses returned by services.
  This should remain true *whether or not* those services actually return the same content as they did at the moment the tests were written.

  These are handled using :ref:`recorded responses <recorded-responses>`, as described above.
  This makes the test outcomes deterministic, even if the services are periodically unavailable.

  These tests use :func:`.session_with_stored_responses`, which is an in-memory :class:`~requests_cache.CachedSession` prepared using:

  - The recorded/stored responses from ``sdmx-test-data``.
  - Other responses generated by :func:`.add_responses` / :func:`.save_response`.
  - :func:`.offline` / :class:`.OfflineAdapter`.
    This ensures that *only* the cached URLs/requests can be queried; all other queries raise :class:`.RuntimeError`.

Releasing
=========

Before releasing, check:

- https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/actions?query=workflow:test+branch:main to ensure that the push and scheduled builds are passing.
- https://readthedocs.org/projects/sdmx1/builds/ to ensure that the docs build is passing.

Address any failures before releasing.

1. Create a new branch::

     $ git checkout -v release/X.Y.Z

2. Edit :file:`doc/whatsnew.rst`.
   Comment the heading "Next release", then insert another heading below it, at the same level, with the version number and date.

3. Make a commit with a message like "Mark vX.Y.Z in doc/whatsnew".

4. Tag the version as a release candidate, i.e. with a ``rcN`` suffix, and push::

    $ git tag vX.Y.ZrcN
    $ git push --tags --set-upstream origin release/X.Y.Z

5. Open a pull request with the title “Release vX.Y.Z” using this branch.
   Check:

   - at https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/actions?query=workflow:publish that the workflow completes: the package builds successfully and is published to TestPyPI.
   - at https://test.pypi.org/project/sdmx1/ that:

      - The package can be downloaded, installed and run.
      - The README is rendered correctly.

   If needed, address any warnings or errors that appear and then continue from step (3), i.e. make (a) new commit(s) and tag, incrementing the release candidate number, e.g. from ``rc1`` to ``rc2``.

6. Merge the PR using the “rebase and merge” method.

7. (optional) Tag the release itself and push::

    $ git tag vX.Y.Z
    $ git push --tags origin main

   This step (but *not* step (3)) can also be performed directly on GitHub; see (7), next.

8. Visit https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/releases and mark the new release: either using the pushed tag from (7), or by creating the tag and release simultaneously.

9. Check at https://github.com/khaeru/sdmx/actions?query=workflow:publish and https://pypi.org/project/sdmx1/ that the distributions are published.
