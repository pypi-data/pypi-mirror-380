def escape_path(pth: str | bytes) -> str:

    Escapes a path so that it can be represented faithfully in an HDF5

    must be escaped. ``'/'`` and null must be escaped to. Backslashes
    are escaped as double backslashes. Other escaped characters are
    replaced with ``'\xYY'``, ``'\uYYYY', or ``'\UYYYYYYYY'`` where Y
    are hex digits depending on the unicode numerical value of the

def process_path(pth: Path) -> tuple[str, str]:  # noqa: C901
    """Process paths.

    Processes the provided path and breaks it into it Group part
    (`groupname`) and target part (`targetname`). ``bytes`` paths are
    converted to ``str``. Separated paths are given as an iterable of
    ``str`` and ``bytes``. Each part of a separated path is escaped
    using ``escape_path``. Otherwise, the path is assumed to be already
    escaped. Escaping is done so that targets with a part that starts
    with one or more periods, contain slashes, and/or contain nulls can
    be used without causing the wrong Group to be looked in or the wrong
    target to be looked at. It essentially allows one to make a Dataset
    named ``'..'`` or ``'a/a'`` instead of moving around in the Dataset
    hierarchy.

    All paths are POSIX style.

    .. versionadded:: 0.2

    Parameters
    ----------
    pth : str or bytes or pathlib.PurePath or Sequence
        The POSIX style path as a ``str`` or ``bytes`` or the
        separated path in an Sequence with the elements being ``str``,
        ``bytes``, and ``pathlib.PurePath``. For separated paths,
        escaping will be done on each part.

    Returns
    -------
    groupname : str
        The path to the Group containing the target `pth` was pointing
        to.
    targetname : str
        The name of the target pointed to by `pth` in the Group
        `groupname`.
