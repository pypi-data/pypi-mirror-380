YANG Diffs
==========

Making use of the dataset functionality can also produce datasets that will
show changes of a module between versions. To do this, choose 2 YANG
sets, one containing the base to compare from and another YANG set to compare to.
The comparison can be based on a single module, a set of modules, or a "Module category".

There are 30+ possible data points associated to each xpath.
Choose "Included columns" (default" All columns) or "Excluded columns" (default: none).
When doing a diff, the "Excluded columns" should always have "revision" chosen otherwise
every xpath will be different because each will have a different revision number.

Actions:

- Display dataset differences - A new browser window will show the results of
  the dataset differences (must select "Compare YANG Set" and "Base YANG Set").
- Download dataset differences - A file will be downloaded to the browser which
  is in a format that can be imported into various other applications such as
  Microsoft Excel or Apple numbers (must select "Compare YANG Set" and "Base
  YANG Set").

The result will produce a dataset that shows the differences between the two, A
possible dataset of new xpaths, and a possible dataset of removed xpaths.
