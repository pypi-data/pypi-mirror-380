Datasets
========

YANG models are designed in a hierachial fashion represented in xpath notation.
Analytics gives you the capability of producing datasets with the xpath
representing the key and data associated to the xpath as the columns.

The only required field is the xpath.

Choose a "Base YANG Set" and the YANG module(s) in the set that you want the
dataset based on. There are 30+ possible data points associated to each xpath.
Choose "Included columns" (default" All columns) or "Excluded columns" (default: none).

Actions:

- Display dataset - A new browser window will show the results of the dataset.
- Download dataset - A file will be downloaded to the browser which is in a
  format that can be imported into various other applications such as Microsoft
  Excel or Apple numbers.

More than one YANG module or a "Module category" can be selected to "Display dataset", but,
the resulting new browser window may be too large to realistically view.  "Download dataset"
is a better option in this case.
