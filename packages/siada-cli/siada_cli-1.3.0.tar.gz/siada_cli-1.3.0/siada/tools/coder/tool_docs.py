EDIT_DOCS= """Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a text file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [".xlsx", ".pptx", ".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".flac", ".pdf", ".docx"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`
* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.


Before using this tool:
1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context
2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):
   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location

When making edits:
   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code
   - Do not leave the code in a broken state
   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:

1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.

2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:
   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)
   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed

3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.

Remember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.

Args:
    command: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    path: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.
    file_text: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    old_str: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    new_str: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    insert_line: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    view_range: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.
