   - Incomplete root cause resolution
   - Missing critical edge cases or error handling
   - Performance degradation or scalability concerns
   - Security vulnerabilities introduced or not addressed
   - Integration problems with existing systems
   - Insufficient testing or validation
   - Technical debt increase without justification
