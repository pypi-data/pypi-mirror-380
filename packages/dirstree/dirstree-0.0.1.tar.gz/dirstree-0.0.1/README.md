There are many libraries for traversing directories. You can also do this using the standard library. This particular library is very different in that:

- Supports filtering by file extensions.
- Supports filtering in the [`.gitignore` format](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring).
- Natively works with both [`Path` objects](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use) from the standard library and strings.

## Installation

You can install [`dirstree`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dirstree) using pip:

```bash
pip install dirstree
```

You can also quickly try out this and other packages without having to install using [instld](https://github.com/pomponchik/instld).


## Basic usage

It's very easy to work with the library in your own code:

- Create a crawler object, passing the path to the base directory and, if necessary, additional arguments.
- Iterate recursively through the files in this directory using the `.walk()` method.

The simplest code example would look like this:

```python
from dirstree import DirectoryWalker

walker = DirectoryWalker('.')

for file in walker.walk():
    print(file)
```

Here we output recursively (that is, including the contents of nested directories) all files from the current directory. At each iteration, we get a new [`Path` object](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use).

However, we can iterate not over all files in the directory, but only over files with the [extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename_extension) we need, if we pass the collection with the desired extensions when creating the crawler object:

```python
walker = DirectoryWalker('.', extensions=['.txt'])  # Iterate only on .txt files.
```

We can also pass a list of exceptions, specifying files or subdirectories for which we will NOT iterate:

```python
walker = DirectoryWalker('.', exclude_patterns=['.git', 'venv'])  # Exclude ".git" and "venv" directories.
```

Please note that you can specify any files and folders in the [`.gitignore` format](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring).
