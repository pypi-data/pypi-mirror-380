              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# About
**starflow is an open source workflow management platform**, with:

- :desktop_computer: an intuitive [Graphical User Interface](#gui) that facilitates creating, editing and monitoring any type of Workflow, from data processing to machine learning
- :package: a standard way of writing and publishing functional [Pieces](#pieces), which follows good practices for data modeling, documentation and distribution
- :gear: a [REST API](#rest) that controls a running Apache Airflow instance


Creating Workflows in the GUI is as simple as dragging and dropping Pieces to the canvas, and connecting them. The user can schedule the Workflow to run periodically, at a specific date/time, or trigger it manually. The monitoring page shows the status of each Workflow Piece in real time, including the logs and results of each run.

Pieces are functional units that can be reused in multiple Workflows. Pieces can execute anything that can be written in Python, and can be easily distributed and installed directly from Github repositories to be used in starflow Workflows.

Every starflow Workflow corresponds to an Apache Airflow DAG, and each Piece corresponds to an Airflow task. starflow controls an Airflow instance, which is responsible for executing, scheduling and monitoring the Workflows (DAGs).

You can think of starflow as Airflow with superpowers:

- :desktop_computer: create highly complex Workflows with simple point-and-click and drag-and-drop operations, in an user-friendly GUI
- :package: make use of Pieces developed by other people, share and reuse your own Pieces
- :busts_in_silhouette: collaborate in groups to edit and monitor Workflows
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: experience a cleaner and more intuitive GUI for viewing Workflows results, including logs and richer reports with images and tables
- :minidisc: shared storage for tasks in the same workflow
- :arrows_counterclockwise: use gitSync to sync DAGs from files stored in a Git repository
- :wheel_of_dharma: scalable, Kubernetes-native platform
- :battery: powered by Apache Airflow for top-tier workflows scheduling and monitoring

<br>

# Quick start

Check out the quick start guide in the [documentation](https://docs.starflow-workflows.io/quickstart).

The starflow Python package can be installed via pip. We reccommend you install starflow in a separate Python environment.

```bash
pip install starflow-py[cli]
```

You can then use starflow command line interface to easily run the starflow platform locally (requires [Docker Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)). Go to a new, empty directory and run the following command:

```bash
starflow platform run-compose
```

After all processes started successfully, navigate to `localhost:3000` to access the starflow frontend service. <br>
Obs.: the first time you run the platform, it may take a few minutes to download the Docker images.

Running the starflow platform locally with Docker compose is useful for development and testing purposes. For production environments, we recommend you deploy starflow and Airflow to a Kubernetes cluster. For other deployment modes, check out the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.starflow-workflows.io/category/run-starflow).

<br>

# GUI
The starflow frontend service is a React application that provides the GUI for easily creating, editing and monitoring Workflows. Check out the [GUI documentation](https://docs.starflow-workflows.io/starflow_components/starflow_components_gui) for more details.

# Pieces

![Pieces](https://github.com/prochain-star-atlas/starflow/blob/gif/media/pieces_distribution.gif)

Pieces are the secret sauce of starflow, they are functional units that can be distributed and reused in multiple Workflows. starflow Pieces are special because they:

- :snake: can execute anything written in Python, heavy-weight (e.g. Machine Learning) as well as light-weight (e.g. sending emails) tasks
- :traffic_light: have well defined data models for inputs, outputs and secrets
- :package: run in self-contained and isolated execution environments (Docker containers)
- :gear: are immutable, guaranteeing reproducibility of your workflows

It is very easy to create and share your own Pieces:

1. write your Python function as a Piece <br>
2. define the data types, dependencies, metadata and tests <br>
3. publish in a git repository (public or private)

The [Pieces repository template](https://github.com/prochain-star-atlas/starflow_pieces_repository_template) provides the basic structure, example files and automatic actions for a seamless Pieces creation experience.

# REST
The Backend service is a REST API that controls a running Apache Airflow instance. It is responsible for:

- executing operations requested by the frontend service
- interacting with the Airflow instance, including triggering, creating, editing and deleting Workflows (DAGs)
- interacting with the starflow Database

The REST service is written in Python, using the FastAPI framework. Read more about it in the [REST documentation](https://docs.starflow-workflows.io/starflow_components/starflow_components_rest).
