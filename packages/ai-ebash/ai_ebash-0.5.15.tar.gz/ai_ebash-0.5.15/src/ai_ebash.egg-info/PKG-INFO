> **Integrate artificial intelligence into your terminal.** Ask questions to ***ChatGPT***, ***Deep Seek***, ***Grok*** and many other large language models (LLM). Execute scripts and commands suggested by the neural network directly from the command line. Perfect for beginners in Linux and Windows administration.

## Description

### Features

- **Quick AI queries** — Get answers from large language models via the command line
- **No GUI** — Communicate with your chosen AI in natural language and any locale: ai how to install Russian fonts?
- **Interactive dialog mode** — Chat with AI in dialog mode with preserved conversation context
- **Code execution** — Execute scripts and commands suggested by AI in the console
- **Friendly interface** — Formatted output with syntax highlighting — just like you’re used to when working with neural networks
- **Multiple AI providers** — Support for OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Anthropic and other popular providers
- **Multi-language support** — En and Ru are available now. You can [(help with translation)](#contributing) into other languages.

### Quick Start

Install AI-eBash using one of the convenient [methods](#installation).

Run the program `ai who are you?`. In a couple of seconds, the neural network will respond:

![program response1](/docs/img/ru_img1.png)

Try something more complex:

![program response2](/docs/img/ru_img3.png)

On first launch, the program uses a Microsoft-hosted model — **DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview** with a public token. This is not the best option since you may see a quota-exceeded message due to high traffic, but it’s fine for a test run.

**For full operation, you need to [obtain](#getting-a-token-api_key-and-connecting-to-a-pre-installed-model) a personal token and add it to the selected model in the program [settings](#installation).**

> [!NOTE]
> AI-eBash can work with any neural network that supports API access. Today this includes almost all large language models (LLMs) on the market. [How to add a new model](#adding-a-new-model).

## Connecting to Neural Networks
AI-eBash ships with several popular models pre-configured, such as **DeepSeek**, **Grok 4 Fast**, **Qwen3 Coder**. However, provider policies don’t allow full operation without authorization. You must obtain a personal token (API_KEY) from the provider’s website.

### Getting a Token (API_KEY) and Connecting to a Pre-installed Model
We recommend the provider [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0) — simple registration and dozens of popular models available for free with a single token.

- Register on the [website](https://openrouter.ai/)
- Get a token by clicking **[Create API key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)**. Save it — OpenRouter will show it only once!
- Add the token to AI-eBash in the [settings](#configuration) of the selected model
- Make this model the current one

**Done! Now the selected model will answer you in the console. You can connect any other model from this website in the same way.**

> [!NOTE]
> One OpenRouter token is valid for **all** models available from this provider.

A similar procedure applies to other providers, although with **OpenRouter** available, you may not need it.

### Adding a New Model
To add a **new** model to AI-eBash, including a local model or one from major providers, simply enter in AI-eBash [settings](#configuration):
 - API_KEY (your personal token)
 - API_URL (API base URL)
 - model (model name)

You can find this information on the provider’s website in the *API* section.

#### Connection Example
Using the example of the free **Meta: Llama 3.1** model listed on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/models?max_price=0) among dozens of other free models.

Open the model’s page and find the [API](https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct:free/api) section.

Among the connection examples, look for information similar to:

 - **API_URL** — for OpenRouter, this parameter is called ***base_url***
 - **model** — listed as ***model***

How to get **API_KEY** is described [above](#getting-a-token-api_key-and-connecting-to-a-pre-installed-model).

Enter these values (***without quotes***) in AI-eBash settings and set this model as current. Now ***Meta: Llama 3.1*** will answer your questions.

## Examples

### Quick Query

```bash
# Simple question
ai kernel update script
```

### Dialog Mode

To start a dialog, use the `-d` key or simply type `ai` and press `Enter`.
In dialog mode, AI-eBash preserves the conversation context throughout the session.

```bash
a i -d what python version is installed?
```

```bash
a i  # Enter
```

### Running Code from AI Response

When **in dialog mode**, if the response contains code blocks — they are numbered. To run code, simply enter the block number in the console.

## Security

> [!WARNING]
> Never execute code suggested by the neural network if you’re not sure what it does!

### Best Practices

1. **Review code before execution**
   ```bash
   # Always check what AI suggests
   ai Delete all files from /tmp  # Don’t run this blindly!
   ```

2. **Use safe commands**
   ```bash
   # Prefer these over destructive operations
   ai Show disk usage
   ai Show running processes
   ```

## Installation

### Ubuntu/Debian (pipx)

**Recommended installation method**

1. **Install pipx** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install pipx python3-venv -y
   pipx ensurepath
   ```

2. **Restart the terminal**

3. **Install AI-eBash**:
   ```bash
   pipx install ai-ebash
   ```

> **Note:** If pipx doesn’t work, you can install via pip:
> ```bash
> pip install ai-ebash
> ```

### Ubuntu/Debian (DEB Package)

1. **Download the latest DEB package from [GitHub](https://github.com/Vivatist/ai-ebash/releases/latest)**:
   ```bash
   wget -qO ai-ebash.deb $(wget -qO- https://api.github.com/repos/Vivatist/ai-ebash/releases/latest \
     | grep "browser_download_url.*\.deb" | cut -d '"' -f 4)
   ```

2. **Install the package**:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i ./ai-ebash.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f -y
   ```

3. **Restart the terminal**

1. **Install Python 3.11+** (if not installed)

2. **Install AI-eBash**:
   ```cmd
   pip install ai-ebash
   ```

3. **Restart the terminal**
