You are evaluating the relevance of the source to a user's query. Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************
[Source]: {{ src }}
************
[User Query]: {{ user_query }}
************
[END DATA]

Determine whether the source contains the relevant and necessary information needed to respond to the user's query. The available assessments are:
`Fully Relevant` - The source text contains the information necessary to respond to the user's query.
`Partially Relevant` - The source text is partially relevant to the user's query, but does not contain all the information necessary to respond to the user's query.
`Not Relevant` - The source text is not relevant to the user's query.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. Output your thought process first, and then provide your final answer.
