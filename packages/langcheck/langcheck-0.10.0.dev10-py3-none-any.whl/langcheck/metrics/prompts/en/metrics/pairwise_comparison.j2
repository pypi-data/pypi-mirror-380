You are comparing the quality of two responses to a user's query.
{% if (src_a is not none  or src_b is not none) and ref_output is not none %}
Source text that is supposedly relevant to the user's query is also provided to you as a reference (the source text may contain some duplication).
The ideal response to the user's query is also provided to you as a reference.
{% elif src_a is not none or src_b is not none%}
Source text that is supposedly relevant to the user's query is also provided to you as a reference (the source text may contain some duplication).
{% elif ref_output is not none %}
The ideal response to the user's query is provided to you as a reference.
{% endif %}
Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************
[User Query]: {{ user_query }}
************
{% if src_a is not none and src_b is not none %}
[Source]: {{ src_a }}
{{ src_b }}
************
{% elif src_a is not none %}
[Source]: {{ src_a }}
************
{% elif src_b is not none %}
[Source]: {{ src_b }}
************
{% endif %}
{% if ref_output is not none %}
[Ideal Response]: {{ ref_output }}
************
{% endif %}
[Response A]: {{ gen_output_a }}
************
[Response B]: {{ gen_output_b }}
************
[END DATA]

Determine which of the responses is a better response to the user's query.
{% if (src_a is not none  or src_b is not none) and ref_output is not none %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment,
using the provided Source and the Ideal Response as references.
{% elif src_a is not none or src_b is not none %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment, using the provided Source as a reference.
{% elif ref_output is not none %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment, using the Ideal Response as a reference.
{% else %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment.
{% endif %}
Do not allow the order in which the responses were presented to influence your assessment.
Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your assessment. The available assessments are:
`Response A` - Response A is a better response.
`Response B` - Response B is a better response.
`Tie` - The two responses are roughly equal in quality.
