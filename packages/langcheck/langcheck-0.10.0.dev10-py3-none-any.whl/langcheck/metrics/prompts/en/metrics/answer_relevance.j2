You are evaluating the relevance of the answer to a user's query. Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************
[User Query]: {{ user_query }}
************
[Answer]: {{ gen_output }}
************
[END DATA]

Determine whether the answer is a relevant response to the user's query.
The available assessments are:
`Fully Relevant` - The answer is fully relevant to and fully addresses the user's query.
`Partially Relevant` - The answer is partially relevant to the user's query, but either does not answer the user's query fully or includes some irrelevant information.
`Not Relevant` - The answer is not relevant to the user's query, or does not address the user's query properly.
