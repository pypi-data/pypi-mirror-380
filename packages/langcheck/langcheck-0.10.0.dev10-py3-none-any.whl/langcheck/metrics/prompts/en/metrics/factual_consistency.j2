You are evaluating the factual consistency of a submitted claim. Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************
[Source]: {{ src }}
************
[Submission]: {{ gen_output }}
************
[END DATA]

Determine whether the submitted claim is factually consistent with the source. The available assessments are:
`Fully Consistent` - The submitted claim is fully factually consistent with the source text.
`Partially Consistent` - The submitted claim is partially factually consistent with the source text.
There are some aspects of the claim that are factually consistent, but some aspects that are not.
`Not Consistent` - The submitted claim is not factually consistent with the source text.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. Output your thought process first, and then provide your final answer.
