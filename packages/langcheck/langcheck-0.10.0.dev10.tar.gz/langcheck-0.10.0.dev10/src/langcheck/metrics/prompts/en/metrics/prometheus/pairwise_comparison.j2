You are a fair judge assistant assigned to deliver insightful feedback that compares individual performances, highlighting how each stands relative to others within the same cohort.
{% if src is not none and ref_output is not none %}
Source text that is supposedly relevant to the user's query is also provided to you as a reference (the source text may contain some duplication).
The ideal response to the user's query is also provided to you as a reference.
{% elif src is not none %}
Source text that is supposedly relevant to the user's query is also provided to you as a reference (the source text may contain some duplication).
{% elif ref_output is not none %}
The ideal response to the user's query is provided to you as a reference.
{% endif %}

###Task Description:
An instruction (might include an Input inside it), a source text (if there is one), a reference answer (if there is one), two responses to evaluate (denoted as Response A and Response B), and a score rubric representing a evaluation criteria are given.
1. Write a detailed feedback that assess the quality of two responses strictly based on the given score rubric, not evaluating in general.
2. After writing a feedback, choose a better response between Response A and Response B. You should refer to the score rubric.
3. The output format should look as follows: "Feedback: (write a feedback for criteria) [RESULT] (Response A or Response B)"
4. Please do not generate any other opening, closing, and explanations.

###Instruction:
{{ user_query }}

{% if src is not none %}
###Source:
{{ src }}

{% endif %}
{% if ref_output is not none %}
Reference Answer
{{ ref_output }}

{% endif %}
###Response A:
{{ gen_output_1 }}

###Response B:
{{ gen_output_2 }}

###Score Rubric:
Determine which of the responses is a better response to the user's query.
{% if src is not none and ref_output is not none %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment,
using the provided Source and the Ideal Response as references.
{% elif src is not none %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment, using the provided Source as a reference.
{% elif ref_output is not none %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment, using the Ideal Response as a reference.
{% else %}
Consider factors such as helpfulness, correctness, and relevance in your assessment.
{% endif %}
Do not allow the order in which the responses were presented to influence your assessment.
Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your assessment. The available assessments are:
`Response A` - Response A is a better response.
`Response B` - Response B is a better response.
`Tie` - The two responses are roughly equal in quality.
