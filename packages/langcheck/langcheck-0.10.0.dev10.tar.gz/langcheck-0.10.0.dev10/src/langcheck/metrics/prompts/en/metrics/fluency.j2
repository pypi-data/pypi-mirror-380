You are evaluating the fluency of a submitted statement. Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************
[Submission]: {{ gen_output }}
************
[END DATA]

Determine the fluency of the submitted statement. The available assessments are:
`Poor` - The statement has many errors that make it hard to understand or sound unnatural.
`Fair` - The statement has some errors that affect the clarity or smoothness of the text, but the main points are still comprehensible.
`Good` - The statement has few or no errors and is easy to read and follow.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. Output your thought process first, and then provide your final answer.
