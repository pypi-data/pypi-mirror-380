class GroupMiddleware(SubscriberMiddleware):
    """
    A middleware that runs multiple middlewares in parallel.

    This middleware allows you to group several `SubscriberMiddleware` instances
    and execute them concurrently for a given event. This is useful for scenarios
    where you want to apply multiple, independent side effects or checks to an event
    without blocking on each one sequentially.

    Args:
        middlewares (List[SubscriberMiddleware]): The list of middlewares to run in parallel.
        fail_fast (bool): If True, the group will stop and raise as soon as any middleware fails,
            cancelling the remaining tasks. If False, all middlewares are run and errors are logged,
            but exceptions are not propagated.

    Usage:
        group = GroupMiddleware([LoggingMiddleware(), MetricsMiddleware()], fail_fast=True)
        await group(call_next, event)

    Note:
        - The order of execution is not guaranteed.
        - If `fail_fast` is True, the first exception will be raised and remaining middlewares cancelled.
        - If `fail_fast` is False, all exceptions are logged and execution continues.

    Middleware that applies a retry policy to the event handler.

    This middleware wraps the downstream handler (or next middleware) with a retry mechanism,
    allowing transient errors to be retried according to the provided `RetryPolicy`.
    It is useful for handling intermittent failures, such as network issues or temporary
    unavailability of external services, without failing the entire event processing pipeline.

    Args:
        retry_policy (RetryPolicy): An instance of a retry policy that defines how and when
            to retry the handler. This can be a custom policy or a standard one such as
            `ExponentialBackoffPolicy`.

    Example:
        >>> retry_middleware = RetryMiddleware(ExponentialBackoffPolicy(max_attempts=5))
        >>> await retry_middleware(handler, event)

    Method:
        __call__(call_next, event): Invokes the next handler with retry logic applied.

    Raises:
        Any exception not handled by the retry policy will be propagated.
