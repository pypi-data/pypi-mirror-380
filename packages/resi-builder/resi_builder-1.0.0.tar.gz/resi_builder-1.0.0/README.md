## Build Resume

In order to make a preview resume use the following


```python
import resi

# import the job desc from a text file
with open('job_desc.txt', 'r') as f:
    job_desc = f.read()


# Build the preview data - output will be a python dictionary
resume_data =  resi.resume.build_resume_preview(
    job_desc,
    'user_history.json', # Importing a file via file path. This can also be dictionary
    'Be sure to not include any special characters like: !@#$' # Optional additional prompts
)

# Build the file
resi.resume.build_resume_pdf(
