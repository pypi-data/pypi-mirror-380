    Check that a given parameter has the expected type and optional
    specifications.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        Name of the parameter. Will be returned in the exception.
    value
        Value of the parameter.
    expected_type
        Expected type of the parameter.
    expected_values
        Optional. Check that the value is one of these possible values.
    contents_type
        Optional. For a tuple or list, ensures that every element is of the
        given type. For a dictionary, ensures that every value is of the
        given type. Does not recurse into nested variables.
    key_type
        Optional. Check that every key of a dictionary is of a given type. Does not
        recurse into nested variables.
    length
        Optional. Check that a tuple or list has a fixed length.
    ndims
        Optional. Check that an array has a given number of dimensions.
    shape
        Optional. Check that an array has a given shape. Use -1 for
        dimensions that do not matter. For instance, to check if an array
        has a shape of Nx4x4, we would use `shape = (-1, 4, 4)`.

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        The value.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the value or its contents is of the wrong type.
    ValueError
        If the value does not meet the given criteria.
